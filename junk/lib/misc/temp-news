    **- WHAT OPENING MEANS:
      
       -Let us take this time to make everyone clear on what 'opening' means.
       Opening does NOT mean 'done' ... it does NOT mean 'perfect' .. and it
       certainly does NOT mean 'STATIC'.  This mud will continue to change and
       evolve at the same rate we have in the past. New hometowns will be
       added, new classes will be added, existing classes will change, justice
       will expand and grow, a few OLD bugs will exist and be fixed, NEW bugs
       will be introduced. The mud is by NO means finished.

       What opening does mean is that you, the player, can be secure in the
       fact that none of your hard work will be lost. We chose now to open
       because we have enough good/evil balance to support race wars and
       because we will NOT need to make any more changes that require a pfile
       wipe. Beta testing gave us the needed info to get the game in a very
       playable, fair and fairly balanced state. It means that if a bug eats
       your hard earned equip, it will be reimb'd .. if your character is
       harmed unfairly by a bug, you will be reparied .. it means more work
       for us :p ... it means you can be secure knowing that your hard work
       will not be lost. 

       That is what opening means :) It's taken alot of work to get to this
       point and will take alot of hard work to finally get to the mud of our
       visions. We would like to thank EVERYONE that has put up with the 
       hardships of beta testing, we couldnt have reached this point without
       your help.
