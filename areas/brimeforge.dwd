&+LInside the &+rBrim&+LStone Forge&n~
   &+LThis strange little crevice seems almost impossible to see from the outside. Yet, once
&+Linside, you realize that it is rather large. The room smells of thick sulfur and the floor
&+Llooks to be frequently used by many a strange creature. Despite your best efforts, you gag
&+Lfrom the smell of what seems like rotting flesh.&n
