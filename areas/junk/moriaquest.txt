Moria Quest suggestion...

Malchor is the one to give items to, he got the quest info (ask malchor masters/rune/
emerald/diamond/ruby/sapphire/amethyst	) I once had this powerful artifact in my museum that could
divine the forest power's into five. The magichian society did not like the fact someone 
could gain more power then them so they sent five of the most mighty magichians they had to
collect this artifact from me. I will pay you well if you can manage to bring the pieces
of whats left of it back to me, it has a value that no one can understand for such an old man
as me.... But be aware my friend, these magichians fear no way to protect their powers being
the most poweful in this dimension.

Asking the masters will result with they answer you with : We had to do this so we can
continue live in a safe world, please understand us stranger or we will have to protect the
world with the powers of all dimensions!.

Malchor sais when you have given him all items: Finaly! You have brought back the most
valuable item I ever had.... I will give you this (insert item depending on wich rune
were given last) as thank for your heroic effort. Have a good jorney in the future my friend.
