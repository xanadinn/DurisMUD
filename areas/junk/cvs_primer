Checking out a new working area
-------------------------------

When you don't have a CVS'd working directory for areas, you need
to create one:

- Go to the directory you want your areas directory to be in, for
  example the main Duris areas reside in '/duris/mainmud'
- Issue the command 'cvs checkout areas'

This will create a directory called 'areas' in the current directory
with the contents of the areas repository.


Making changes to areas
-----------------------

First off, switch into your working directory (eg. /duris/mainmud/areas)

1. Issue the command 'cvs update' ... this will update all files with
   any CVS committed changes.
2. Make your changes
3. Re-issue the command 'cvs update' just in case someone's made any changes
   in the meantime
4. Issue the command 'cvs commit' to commit your changes to the CVS
   repository, and describe the changes made in the CVS log.
5. Edit the ChangeLog with your changes.


Adding new areas to the repository
----------------------------------

When you want to add a brand new area to the repository, you must
do the following ... this example assumes the area file is named
'newarea' (so the obj file would be newarea.obj, mob file would be
newarea.mob, etc)

1. Issue the command 'cvs update'
2. Copy the zone files into the proper subdirectories (obj/mob/zon etc)
3. Issue the command './add_area.sh newarea' and replace 'newarea' with
   the name of the zone files (without the .??? suffix)
4. Issue the command 'cvs update'
5. Issue the command 'cvs commit' to add the area to the repository
6. Edit ChangeLog
