                    I. FAQ ABOUT AREA MAKING ON DURIS MUD
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Many people have come forward with interest in making areas for
Duris, and this document was prepared to answer any questions you
might have about the process.  The entire task of area creation can be
summed up in one phrase:  "Area creation is not hard, just tedious --
it requires a lot of imagination."


Step 1 -  The Mechanics:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Area creation for Duris requires NO coding or programming knowledge
of ANY kind.  All it requires is patience and imagination.  All you
need to create an area is a standard word processor.

* Using a Standard Word Processor

This is a fine method of making a zone (although somewhat more
time-consuming than certain area editors out there, i.e. daed, dikued)
and many gods prefer this method.

Zone files are similar to the gamma Diku format, with the exception of
a lot of additions for Duris, and are simple text files.  Making a
zone with a word processor is akin to writing a book on the computer,
albeit with some added math and formatting.

* Using an Editor

One of our gods, Tavril, has coded an editor specifically for use with
DurisMUD. It is available by ftping to the Duris ftp site:
ftp duris.sojourn.com and is located in the /pub directory. The editor
is named DE and will be available for several OS.

Step 2 - Making the Zone:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Regardless of what method you use to make your area, there are many
formatting and stylistic rules you MUST follow when you are
making areas for Duris.  Below we have listed the most important (or
frequently asked about) tips on zone-making:

a) When making a room, you MUST indent 3 spaces in the beginning
of the room description.  Make sure you capitalize your room titles
appropriately, according to the accepted rules of grammar.

"Inside the Damp Cavern of Mushrooms"           - Acceptable.
"Inside the damp cavern of mushrooms"           - NOT acceptable.

In the previous example, the important descriptive words of the room
title should be capitalized.

b) Try to be grammatically correct with your zones.  Good
spelling is important, and how people view your work will reflect
either positively or negatively on the mud.  It's not something we
will get angry over, but people are quick to point out typos. Note
that if you use poor grammar, YOU will be expected to fix it.

c) Room descriptions that contain only one or two lines of text
are highly frowned upon.  A room description that consists of only one
sentence downgrades your zone and detracts from the overall effect it
will have on people.  A few of these are okay, but we will send back
any zone that is predominantly one- to two-line descriptions.  Two to
five sentences per room is desirable, depending on the level of detail
in any given room, with an average of around 4-5 lines/room for the
entire zone.

d) Many zone writers view making a zone as simply coming up with
ten different descriptions and duplicating them each 100 times.  This
is *not* acceptable on Duris.  However, in some cases, duplicate
room descriptions are fine, and even necessary in many instances.
Using the example of the vast Trackless Sea, it would have been sheer
madness to come up with 5,000 different room descriptions for the
ocean.  Also, in places that are *intended* to be repetitious such as
mazes or endless forests, duplicate room descriptions can be an
invaluable tool for confusing players.

As a general rule:  don't use many duplicate rooms unless there is a
good reason why they are repetitious.  However, we will not turn away
zones if you have some duplicates that are made out of laziness, but
repetition is frowned upon in practice and should be used with care.
If a zone contains more than 20% duplicate rooms, it is turned away
immediately.

e) Plot/Theme:  Every zone you make should be built around a plot
or a theme.  Zones that are made off-handedly, with "a little bit of
everything" thrown in, are often confusing and hard to fit into the
realism of the Duris interior world environment.  The only tip here
is that you should follow a theme for your zone.  For example, you
could create themes such as "The Kobold Village" or "The Underdark"
and make everything in your zone fit that theme as closely as
possible.  Taking your time and coming up with interesting and
intriguing little plots and twists within your zone can often make it
famous overnight.

f) Quality over quantity!  I cannot stress this point enough.
While many area makers judge themselves and other makers by how many
rooms they have made, this is actually not a good scale in practice
unless you are considering someone's zone as their application for
maker status or some such thing.  I have seen a dozen zones in my time
that were only 100 rooms that, because of their sheer quality, walked
all over many 300-room zones.  It's easier and more rewarding to make
100 rooms of *really awesome* zone than 300 rooms of "okay" zone.

g) Maps/Ideas:  It is always a good idea to talk first with a god
about your area to make sure it is acceptable for Duris.  Once this
is done, it is considered sound practice to make a graph-paper map of
your entire zone, outlining all your connect-points and details.  This
helps you get a good feel for the area and what you might be missing,
as well as ensuring it is geographically sound.  A map also helps in
mob placement and debugging, so it is a good thing to have handy.


The above are just a few of the more important and most frequently
misunderstood aspects of area creation on Duris.  There is also a
list of about 15 more such tips in the Duris docs below that you
*should* read if you are planning to make a zone for us.


Step 3 - What Kind of Zones Will Duris Accept?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
There are a few criteria that are a MUST for any zone going into
Duris.  These are non-negotiable terms:

a) The zone *must* be original.  We do not want to add any zone
into Duris that can be found on *any* other mud.  Soon all the stock
zones will be gone and we will be 100% original world.  To this end,
we require that any area you give to Duris not be found on other
muds as well.  We want people to be able to find Duris's zones only
on Duris.  If the zone is later found in several other muds, it
could be removed from Duris.

b) The zone *must* be realistic to an AD&D world.  We do not
demand that your zones be built around the Forgotten Realms, but they
*must* be able to fit into that world in some manner.  For example:
no smurf zones, no silly zones, no Amazon Woman Visiting from Mars
zones, etc.  Just so long as it is in the flavor of AD&D fantasy, you
should be okay.

c) Note on zone syntax:  as stated in the past, you will receive a
MAKER status god for making a quality area.  The policy below is
important, as it is the portion that protects us, the Implementors of
Duris, as we use your area:

        "All people who donate and/or make an area for Duris and
        receive MAKER status for its incorporation into the mud are
        bound by the following:  you CANNOT at a later date demand
        that the zone be removed from the mud for ANY reason!  Once a
        zone is given to and becomes a part of Duris, it is
        permanently the property of Duris.  For example, if at a
        later date a MAKER is caught cheating and is demoted for it,
        the maker CANNOT in turn demand that Duris remove the zone
        in question."

Also, as a policy statement to protect you, the zone maker:

        "If you donate and/or make an area for Duris, and that area
        is used in the mud, only YOU, the area maker, have the right
        to govern what happens to that zone as far as distribution is
        concerned.  In other words, we, the Forgers of Duris, hereby
        guarantee that your area will NOT be given to ANYONE for any
        reason.  It will remain under tight lock and key at all times
        so that your hard work is not stolen and distributed all over
        the Internet.  To that end, we accept responsibility for the
        security of any zone donated to us."

These policies protect both the mud owners and the area makers
regarding the legality of using someone else's work, and clarify for
all our determination to make a 100% realistic world that can be found
no where else on the (virtual) globe.


Step 4 - Details! Details!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Here are some frequently asked questions about areas on Duris and
details regarding area creation:

Q: How do I determine experience points for my mobs?
A: Our mobile converter automatically assigns experience point values
depending on the mobs' level and characteristics. All you need do is
set the mob to the appropriate level, race, type, align and AFF/ACT
flags (detailed below). The converter will do the rest.

Q: What about equipment stats (weapon damages and such)?
A: As above, have some of our gods stat a few objects for you.  Not to
worry, if your object stats are off, we will help you adjust them once
the preliminary version of your zone is in for testing.  Additionally,
the docs below are slowly being given sections relating to object
standards and guidelines.  Following those guidelines will insure your
zone fits within Duris and will help reduce its playtest time.

Q: Will I receive a god for my area?
A: Yes. *IF* the area is well done and we use it, you will receive an
AVATAR status god (level 56).  This god is good for approximately three
months time per area you make.  If you want to keep the god or move up
in the world, further contributions of areas or code or cash are
required.  This ensures that someone cannot make one area and still
expect to have a god a year or two from now without continuing to
help.  It also ensures that the people who are currently gods on
Duris are actively contributing to the mud's development.

Q: How can I extend my god's time or move higher?
A: Once your foot is in the door, there are many avenues to
advancement.  We like to reward our people for hard work, and you can
do many things to earn promotions. For example:  more zone work,
administration (if approved by Administration Forger), quests,
role-playing, contributing to any current projects (Home Pages,
role-playing guides) and code work.

Q: Can I choose where my area goes in the mud?
A: Partially.  We like to sit down with the area designers and have
them work with us on the best place for the zone's placement.  The
area designer does have first say as to where it will go, and 99% of
the time they are granted permission to put it in one of their
selected places.  We come into it in that our knowledge of the world
is thorough, and thus we can advise you on things or areas of the
world you might not be aware of.

Those are just some of the more frequently asked questions people have
when they are working on areas, or contemplating making a zone.  Feel
free to ask *any* of our gods for help with your area; we are glad to
do it and to offer you other help in any way possible.  You may also
make questions/comments about items found in this document as you
please. Email mudareas@Duris.com with areas questions, document
comments, or areas submissions (include area theme, approximate zone
level, possible zone placement, and tentative size of zone) and allow
a reasonable time for replies.

                    II. THE WORLD FILE (.WLD)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
The world file contains all the information for the rooms of a zone,
as well as partial information on exits and doors (see .zon file for
additional info on doors). The file is loaded once at boot time and is
called <zone name>.wld

Format of the world-file:
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
#<room number>
<name of room >~
<description>
~
<zone #> <room_flags> <sector_type>
<direction fields>
   <direction sub-fields (if direction exists)>
<extra description fields>
   <extra description sub-fields (if extra descriptions exist)>
<optional fields>
'S'

Note: Characters throughout these docs which are displated as 'char'
      mean use JUST the character in that spot, not to include the '.

Explanation of the World File Fields:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
#<room number>
   This is the number for the room. When scanning down the world file, no
   two rooms should have the same number and the numbers should increase
   down the file. Note, however, that the room numbers do NOT have to be
   sequential, just so long as the room numbers always increase from the
   beginning of the file towards the end there can be gaps in numbers.
   When you first create a room, start with XX000 and continue from there.
   That way, you can later search and replace the XX with whatever zone
   number an implementor assigns you once the zone has been accepted. You
   will note this same format for the other portions of an area.

<name of room>~
   This is the "title" of the room. Note that all room titles should be
   capitalized according to good English (ie. all major words except the,
   of, and etc.) See the example at the end of this section.

<description>
   This is the general description of the room.  At the end of the room
   desc, on the line immediately following the last line of text in the
   desc, put a ~ on the blank line.

<zone #>
   The number of the zone in which this room is located. This number is
   used for resetting zones and monster zone movement.  The number usually
   complements the room numbers, i.e. zone 40 would start with room numbers
   4000-4099. ** However, for your zone #, unless a imp/areas god has given
   you a specific number that you can use, use an unusual letter
   designation such as "aaa" or "ZZZ". Then, the imp can easily replace the
   zone # with the proper one later.

<room_flags>
   A bit vector consisting of the room conditions.  Go through this list
   and decide which flags should affect that particular room.  Then add the
   values together and place the sum in for the room flag.

   DARK ------------------- 1 * Light must be used to see anything, note
                                 that rooms with this flag will ignore

                                 cover
   SINGLE_FILE           8192 * Where people can't go around each other in
                                 a room
   JAIL --------------- 16384 * This is a jail cell, used only in hometowns
   NO_TELEPORT          32768 * A random teleport spell will ignore these
                                 rooms
   PRIV_ZONE ---------- 65536 * ???
   HEAL                131072 * Regeneration of hits/mana is much faster
   NO_HEAL ----------- 262144 * Inhibits good healing/regeneration here

                                 or from

<sector_type>
   This determines how many movement points are used when moving through
   a location of the type - use one of the numbers 0..7 (they are NOT the
   movement-points used - merely indexes to a lookup-table):

   SECT_INSIDE ------------ 0 * Uses as if walking indoors
   SECT_CITY                1 * Uses as if walking in a city
   SECT_FIELD ------------- 2 * Uses as if walking in a field
   SECT_FOREST              3 * Uses as if walking in a forest
   SECT_HILLS ------------- 4 * Uses as if walking in hills
   SECT_MOUNTAIN            5 * Uses as if climbing in mountains
   SECT_WATER_SWIM -------- 6 * Uses as if swimming
   SECT_WATER_NOSWIM        7 * Impossible to swim water - requires a boat
   SECT_NO_GROUND --------- 8 * (must be flying/levitating)
   SECT_UNDERWATER          9 * Need water breathing here
   SECT_UNDERWATER_GR ---- 10 * Underwater, on the bottom.  Can bash

   SECT_UNDRWLD_WILD       13 * [underworld flags: intended to be used for
   SECT_UNDRWLD_CITY ----- 14 *  underground settings; drow, duergars, mind
   SECT_UNDRWLD_INSIDE     15 *  flayers, etc -- details to be fleshed
   SECT_UNDRWLD_WATER ---- 16 *  out later]
   SECT_UNDRWLD_NOSWIM     17 *
   SECT_UNDRWLD_NOGROUND - 18 *
   SECT_PLANE_OF_AIR       19 * Used in the Elemental Plane of Air
   SECT_PLANE_OF_WATER --- 20 * Used in the Elemental Plane of Water
   SECT_PLANE_OF_EARTH     21 * Used in the Elemental Plane of Earth

<direction fields>
   Direction fields are used to provide information about the exits of a
   given room. All of the fields related to a direction only exist if that
   direction is defined for the room. Hence, if a room has no exits, there
   will be NO D<exit number>, <general description>, <keyword list>, <door
   flag>, <key number> or <to-room> information. Furthermore, if there is
   only a north exit, information will only be defined for that direction.

   ** Note about doors: You must make a door in both rooms that the door
                        is set between.


      <direction sub-fields>
       The sub-fields for the direction fields follow the following format:

          D<exit number>
          <exit description>
          ~
          <keyword list>~
          <door flag> <key number> <to-room>

      <exit number>
         Exit number defines the direction of the exit according to the
         following values:

          0 = North
          1 = East
          2 = South
          3 = West
          4 = Up
          5 = Down

      <exit description>
         This text will be what a players sees when they type 'look
         direction'. Follow the lines of text with a ~ on a line by
         itself (as shown in the format above).

      <keyword list>~
         This is a list of keywords for the "door" which will respond to
         commands like "open" and "close". Each word should be sperated
         by a space, and the end of the line should contain a '~' as shown.

      <door flag>
         This value determines the state of the "door", the basic values
         basic values (o,1,2, or3) are explained below:

         0 : no door or an open exit, this is the most common value
         1 : a closed door which can be opened/closed, and is not locked
         2 : a closed door which can be picked/opened/closed, and is locked
         3 : a closed door which cannot be picked, and is locked

         If it is a secret door, then add the vaule 4 to it, this will
         cause the search command to be required before the door can be
         found.

         If it is a blocked exit, then add the value 8 to it.  A switch
         item will be needed to open the exit; ask a god for help if you
         wish to make blocked exits.

         The state of the doors after reset may be controlled by a command
         in the reset-command table (see the zone file). The initial state
         of a door is open.

      <key Number>
         This field can have several values:

         *The number of the object which can unlock/lock the door in the
          direction given. If a player carries/holds this object, they can
          unlock/lock the door.

         *If the key number value is 0, there is no key to the door.

         *If the key number value is -1, the door has no keyhole.

         *If the key number value is -2, the door requires a magic word to
          be said in order for it to open. This magic word will be the last
          value in the door names <keyword list>.

          If the <door flag> above is 0, the value of this field is ignored

      <to_room>
         The virtual number of the room to which the exit leads. If this
         number is -1 (NOWHERE), the exit doesn't lead anywhere. This might
         be useful for adding an exit-description in a direction which
         doesn't actually lead anywhere.

<extra description fields>
   Extra descriptions are used to provide additional information about a
   room if a person looks are certain things described in the room. If a
   room has no extra descriptions, the sub-fields detailed here are not
   included.

      <extra description sub-fields>
       The sub-fields for the extra description field follow the following
       format:

         'E'
         <extra description keyword list>~
         <description>
         ~

      E
      You must always put a capital E preceeding the extra description.

      <extra description keyword list>~
         These are the words which will allow the extra description to be
         seen. The words the player will look at to see the description.
         These keywords must be seperated by blank spaces.

      <description>
         This is the description displayed when a player types 'look at
         <keyword>' which matches one of the words on the keyword list
         above. Follow the lines of text with a ~ on a line by itself
         (as shown in the format above).

NOTE: All the text fields above may be left blank, but the '~' should
      always be there.

<optional fields>
   These are all optional fields and do not need to appear in all rooms
   as they are for more specific circumstances.

   F
   <percentage>

    Chance of falling in the room - be careful, if there is a room below,
    damage will be calculated and the player may continue falling into
    lower rooms. If the original room has no down exit, it is a random-dt.
    (not yet implemented, but we could likely be prodded into it pretty
    easily) - this chance will be evaluated for each command entered - so
    low numbers (5-20%) would be a good average here, except for dangerous/
    tough rooms.

                         ** Please, before attempting to add this flag
                            in, talk to an areas god or imp.
   C
   <current speed> <current direction>

    This option can be used to assign a current speed and direction to a
    ocean or river room. This will eventually affect boat travel and
    similar stuff. <current speed> can be between 0 and 100, while <current

            CREATION STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR THE WORLD FILE
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

   You must follow these guildlines if you plan on making a zone for Duris
   Creating areas can be a rather simple process. The primary element
   necessary is time to add together all the flags and compile the
   oodles of little elements to create the final whole.  Following these
   guidelines throughout your zone will improve its design, solve many
   errors, and make the creation of the zone go more smoothly. Furthermore,
   these guidelines often have purposes such as maintaining mud balance and
   playability which are essential in upkeeping Duris's quality.


   1)  Avoid the use of personal pronouns in descriptions. This implies
       that someone is there when this is not necessarily the case - the
       player reading the description will not necessarily even be in the
       room. This also extends to the idea of presenting actions in
       descriptions. If you fall into the room and land on your head in
       the room description, then you'll do that not only when you enter
       the room, but every time you look - this would not be good for
       anybody's head, I'm certain.

   2)  Indent room descriptions into paragraphs. Most of the indention's
       on the mud now are 3 spaces long. It would be nice to stick to this.
       Furthermore, all room descriptions should be around 4-7 lines long,
       this being ideal to both provide quality images of the zone while
       not being unduely spammy for the players walking in the room.

   3)  Areas don't have to be a series of encounters with monsters which
       are increasingly more dangerous until the grand finale has occurred.
       Players may be more interested in something that is not so straight-
       forward (though it should remain challenging). Basically, this is a
       plea for using creativity when designing an area, and isn't
       necessarily well-defined. Some areas may "work" very well with more
       ordinary approaches - the idea is to encourage the selection of the
       best possible treatment.

   4)  We are trying to make the mud "topologically sane" - so that
       there aren't any non-sensible overlapping of physical areas.
       Overlaps of three (or more) rooms in the same general area aren't
       helpful when connecting areas into a worldwide map, as we are now
       trying to do. It is also helpful not to have confusing directions
       in heavily frequented areas.

   5)  There is also one feature of Duris - single file rooms (see above)
       which requires "directional sanity" with the rooms that surrounds
       it, as it calculates which end of the room list to put people using
       the direction used to enter the room.

   6)  Use new features of Duris. There are a number of unique things
       in Duris, but people won't necessarily know if they aren't used.
       Read on for more specifics on what these are.

   7)  Give some warning to players as to what they may be encountering,
       and (hopefully in a creative way, so as not to be too blunt) give
       them a reasonable guess as to if they have a chance. By this, we do
       not mean tell them they have to be a group of 1 16th level cleric/
       warrior and 2 17th level warrior/thieves, but do give a general idea
       -- is it a good area for mid-level single classes, beginners, or
       high-level multies. While it is agreed that this is not necessarily
       the way real life works, it is a fact that it is more conducive to
       enjoyment of the game. We also recommend use of extra descriptions
       in rooms to warn of nearby danger. This encourages both players and
       area makers to put detail and thought into their exploration/
       creation.

   8)  A note on numbering: It is helpful to number your items, rooms, and
       mobs using an odd letter-prefix, such as "QQ" so that we can move
       your stuff to any section of the world file. Start at "QQ00" in each
       file and move up from there. If you exceed 100 entries, use another
       prefix to indicate that, and let us know what you've done.

   9)  Avoid using the word YOU as much as possible in your world file.
       Why?  Because if someone casts Wizard Eye at a room, they are
       not actually there, just viewing from afar.  Using YOU a lot is just
       generally considered bad form, and reduced the quality of it's
       English. It isn't always avoidable, but should be used only in very
       rare instances (See #1 above)

   10) Perhaps the most important point. ALL areas must be realistic to
       a AD&D fantasy gaming environment. No silly zones like chess boards
       and the like on Duris, we are going for a realistic feel for this
       mud. ** Do not feel that this restricts you from being creative **
       You can make your own zones, as long as they fit the feel of Duris.
       However, before you attempt anything, you should send your ideas for
       a zone to tripod@duris.sojourn.com

   11) Make sure that when you come up with an estimate on how many rooms
       that your zone will require, clear that number with an areas imp
       so that he will have an idea of what numbers you can use. Remember
       this: once you get a set of designated numbers for rooms, you have
       to work within those confines with objects and mobs. For example,
       if a imp says you may number your rooms from 100 to 300, all of
       your objects and mobs MUST be within those numbers. Thus, in the
       case where you have rooms from 100 to 300, if you have 300 objects,
       you would have to have more slots. Just ask the area god for more
       slots so that he knows you are vying for more room for your objects.

   12) Sections of rooms are given out in 100 room sections (zones), thus
       it is most efficient to keep your zone size around a multiple of
       100, and to not exceed this value. For example, a zone of 98 rooms
       would require one set of 100 rooms (say zone 602), while if that
       same zone had 103 rooms, zones 602 and 603 (200 total room numbers)
       would need to be reserved for the maker, effectively wasting 97
       rooms.

   13) Make sure that you do not have any control characters in your files.
       (.wld, .mob, .obj, .zon, .shp or .qst) Some editors will do this,
       and there will be bugs if those control characters exist. I suggest
       using Word Perfect or Microsoft Word when you make a file. Then,
       when you save the file, save it as an "ascii standard" file or
       "ascii" file. This makes the file usable for Duris and eliminates
       any control characters. There are also editors available on the
       duris ftp site.

   13) Make sure that there are NO SPACES in between your directional
       vectors in the .wld file (this goes for the object, zone, and mob
       files also). For example:

       D1
       You see a tree.
       ~
       ~
       0 0 XX001
       D2
       You see a mountain.
       ~
       ~
       0 0 XX001

       The above is acceptable. This is not:

       D1
       You see a tree.
       ~
       ~
       0 0 XX001
             <----------space between direction vectors
       D2
       etc....

       Also, there should NEVER be spaces AFTER tildes (~). That will
       also create problems.

   14) Make sure that you put the EXTRA tilde in your direction vector
       setup. Example:

       D1
       You see trees.
       ~   <----  this tilde is to end the description "You see trees."
       ~   <----  this EXTRA tilde is here because there is no door
       0 0 XX001  to the room going east; thus, there is no key word
                  needed for a door, so we just put a tilde here.

   15) Rooms which are flagged as NO_GROUND must have down exits. The reason
       for this is the necessity for fly/levitate in NO_GROUND rooms and
       the falling which results otherwise, thus the down is needed as a place
       to fall to.

   16) Rooms which are flagged SINGLE_FILE should have exactly two exits.
       Otherwise, the rooms will not be flagged SINGLE_FILE, because the
       order of people in the room could not be determined.

   17) Make sure that if you are doing a cave and make the room lit with
       light, put a description in the room saying there is a torch or
       something providing a light. This would make more sense in a dark
       tunnel or cave. Otherwise, make it dark with the DARK flag.

   18) Make sure that if you DO NOT want certain mobs roaming around in
       other parts of your zone, that you use the NO_MOB flag. Put the
       NO_MOB flag where you would cut off the roaming mobs from
       attempting to leave. It is probably not a good idea to later load
       a mob into that room if it is a NO_MOB room. Note that a HUNTER
       mob, which is hunting, will ignore a NO_MOB room to track its
       victim.

   19) Don't forget to use the INDOORS flag when it is appropriate, or
       you will be getting outside weather in small huts-- that is not
       realistic.

   20) Use the sector number for CITY travelling when there is a pathway
       or stone pathway through an area-- even if that area is not a city.
       The pathway acts just as a pathway would in a city. However, if the
       person is walking through some dense foliage, or climging mountains
       or walking up hills, use the appropriate flag.

                     AN EXAMPLE WORLD FILE WITH COMMENTS
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
This section gives examples of a couple of  rooms of a world file. The
rooms were made to especially display the formats for ~'s, captialization,
exits, doors, and extra descriptions.

#XX1
The First Room of Chaos~
   This room contains several exits, in fact one leading in every possible
direction. Each of these exits has different characteristics to be noted
regarding the various settings of door states, exit directions, keyword
lists, magic doors and such. There are also two objects mentioned in the
room which can be viewed as extra descriptions. First of all, there is a
ceramic vase and then there is the wooden desk which the vase sits upon.
~
1 4104 XX1
D0
This exit leads north to room two. There is no door in this direction..
it is an open exit.
~
~
0 0 XX2
D1
This exit leads east to room three. It has closed door with the keywords
wooden and door.
~
door wooden~
1 0 XX3
D2
This exit leads south to room four. It has a closed and locked door with
the keywords gate and iron.
~
gate iron~
2 0 XX4
D3
This exit leads west to room five. It has an unpickable locked door with
the keywords portal and metal.
~
portal metal~
3 0 XX5
D4
This exit leads up to room six. It has a magic trapdoor which responds
to the word duris and can be opened using door or trapdoor.
~
trapdoor door duris~
3 -2 XX6
D5
This exit leads down to room seven. An unpickable locked door blocks the
way but can be opened if you have the key with virtual number 999.
~
door~
3 999 XX7
E
vase ceramic~
This is a ceramic vase which has been painted with bright green and blue
floral patterns.
~
E
desk wooden~
This wooden desk appears to be quite rustic and well travelled. Scuff
marks and water stains mar its varnished suffer and tell tales of its age.
Several drawers line the right hand side of the desk and a padded swivel
chair rest beneath it. The rool top portion of the desk is littered in
copies of the duris area docs, scratch paper, hastily drawn maps and pages
discussing the characteristics of various nasty fiends and monsters.
~
S
#XX10
The Tenth Room of Chaos~
   This room is filled with the vacuous eddies of chaos. Intelligent
observers will note that the first room was number one and this room is
number ten. that is fine so far as no rooms are out of sequence. I could
skip around all day on room numbers, but I have to keep them within my
zone range (once an implementor has assigned those values) and arranged
from lowest number to highest number within the file. Otherwise though,
this room is very boring. It shows what a room with no exits and no extra
descriptions would look like.

Facts About the Rooms:
----------------------
Room Number:
The room numbers XX1 and XX10 will later be changed according to the zone
numbers assigned by an implementor. Implementors will assign zone "blocks"
is sets of 100 rooms once a zone has been approved. Then, a simple search
and replace in your word processor will give the appropriate values. Other
letter combos can be used if your area will encompass several zones (YY,
ZZ etc.)

Zone Number: 1
Room Flags: INDOORS and NO_PRECIP (8 + 4096 = 4104)
Sector Type: Inside (this is for movement calculation only)

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-                    III. THE MONSTER FILE (.MOB)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Mobiles are stored in the .mob file. Loads of these monsters occurs once at
MUD boot time and again everytime the zone resets (repops), which is
information stored in the ZONE FILE discussed later in these docs. The mob
file is named <zone name>.mob.

Format of the mob-file:
- - - - - - - - - - - -
#<virtual number>
<namelist>~
<short description>~
<long description>

<description>

<action flags> <affect1 flags> <affect2 flags> <alignment> S
<species> <hometown> 0
<Level> <Thac0> <AC> <Hit Points (format is xdy+z)> <Damage (as HP)>
<Gold> <Exp>
<position> <default position> <sex>

Explanation of the Mob File Fields:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
#<virtual number>
   This is the monster's vertual number. You should use values from XX00-
   XX<higest mob number> unless otherwise instructed by an Implementor.
   Other rules are the same as those for the world file room numbers.

<namelist>
   The space-separated name alias list. Use the most "proper" name for the
   mob as the first name in the keyword list. This proper name is the one
   used in the display prompt for enemy and other important locations. It
   looks much better to see yourself fighting a dragon, than fighting a
   gold, if your opponent were a gold dragon for, instance.

   NOTES:
   If the mob is flagged AGG of any type (agg, agg_evil, etc.), you may
   optionally add agg_n or agg_d to its keywords. This will make the mob
   aggro ONLY during night/day respectively. See section under <action
   flags> for more information.

   If a mob if flagged as a dragon, it may be given specific breath weapons
   using the keywords: br_f, br_g, br_c, br_l, and br_a (fire, gas, cold,
   lightning, and acid). If this is not done, the mob will breath a random
   type of breath weapon with each attack. See section under <action flags>
   for more information.

<short description>
   This string will be displayed when the monster take action, for example
   if it is "the powerful cityguard", and the cityguard leaves south the
   message will be "the powerful cityguard leaves south." This is also the
   string displayed during combat

<long description>
   This description is displayed when the monster is in it's "default"
   position. When not in the default position, a message like:
   "<short description> is sleeping here." could be displayed.

<description>
   This will be displayed when a player looks at the monster.

<Alignment Flag>[NL]

   This is the monsters alignment, read as:
    +1000 .. +350   Good Alignment
    +349  .. -349   Neutral Alignment
    -350  .. -1000  Evil Alignment

<Level>
   The only note I will make here is that powerful mobs must be >53 level or
   people will be able to charm them.

<THAC0>
   The monsters THAC0.
   THAC0 is an abbreviation for "To Hit Armor Class Zero".

<AC>
   The monsters armor class.  use 10 to -10

<Hit Points (format is xdy+z)>
   This defines the number of hitpoints a given monster has. If this is
   entered into the file:

    ... ... 3d8+10 ...

   the monster will have 10 hitpoints plus the result of rolling 3 dice
   with 8 side, and adding their sum. All the numbers (even zero), the
   plus sign, and the letter 'd' MUST be entered!!! Example:

   ..... 1d6+0 ....

<Damage Roll (format is xdy+z)>
   (the Bare hand damage). The format is exactly like the one described
   for hit points. A thing to note about damage:
   The number after the plus sign, is the "strength bonus". This bonus
   will apply to any weapons used, and bare hands too. Example:

   ..... 1d4+10

   This monster will damage between 11 and 14 hitpoints each round. If the
   monster picks up and wields a tiny stick which give 1d2 damage, then the
   monster will now damage by : 1d2 + 10 points.

<Gold>
   The amount of gold carried by the monster.

<Exp>
   The experience this monster has. Follow guidelines in "defs.doc".

<position>
   This defines the monster's position when loaded into the game.
   A position is one of:

   POSITION_DEAD ---------- 0 * DO NOT USE
   POSITION_MORTALLYW       1 * DO NOT USE
   POSITION_INCAP --------- 2 * DO NOT USE
   POSITION_STUNNED         3 * DO NOT USE

                                  position)
   POSITION_FLYING ------- 11 * Mob is flying. (Don't use as load pos.)

<default position>
   This is the position into which the monster will return after
   a fight. This position also defines when the <long description>
   is displayed - see above.

<sex>
   This is the monsters sex, one of the following:

   SEX_NEUTRAL   0
   SEX_MALE      1
   SEX_FEMALE    2

<species>
   These are all the mob races currently available on Duris, eventually to be
   expanded further. Underneath the mob races, in parentheses, are the traits
   which that mob race will automatically receive. Please take these into
   account when you design a monster.

            CREATION STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR THE MOB FILE
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
   You must follow these guildlines if you plan on making a zone for Duris
   Creating areas can be a rather simple process. The primary element
   necessary is time to add together all the flags and compile the
   oodles of little elements to create the final whole.  Following these
   guidelines throughout your zone will improve its design, solve many
   errors, and make the creation of the zone go more smoothly. Furthermore,
   these guidelines often have purposes such as maintaining mud balance and
   playability which are essential in upkeeping Duris's quality.

   1)  Short mob descriptions should begin with "the" definite article (the
       Menacing Bureaucrat, the bone-white skeleton). Exceptions, as well,
       would be for certain mobs that are unique (Biff Stud, Miko) and can
       be considered 'proper nouns'. This is somewhat contradictory with
       the "rule" for items, but the way messages are set up and with the
       current contents of those files, this seems the best way to go.

   2)  For mobs, do *not* capitalize anything in the name list. Also, do not
       capitalize the definite pronoun (if used). Obviously, if it is a proper
       noun (such as Biff, Miko), it should be capitalized. These same rules
       apply for objects. Do not capitalize anything in the name list, and do
       not capitalize the indefinite pronoun. Capitalize the short only if it
       is a proper noun such as 'Sting'for a "named weapon"....

   3)  Areas don't have to be a series of encounters with monsters which
       are increasingly more dangerous until the grand finale has occurred.
       Players may be more interested in something that is not so straight-
       forward (though it should remain challenging). Basically, this is a
       plea for using creativity when designing an area, and isn't necessarily
       well-defined. Some areas may "work" very well with more ordinary
       approaches - the idea is to encourage the selection of the best
       possible treatment.

   4)  Use new features of Duris. There are a number of unique things
       in Duris, but people won't necessarily know if they aren't used.
       Read on for more specifics on what these are.

   5)  A note on numbering: It is helpful to number your items, rooms, and
       mobs using an odd letter-prefix, such as "QQ" so that we can move your
       stuff to any section of the world file. Start at "QQ00" in each file
       and move up from there. If you exceed 100 entries, use another prefix
       to indicate that, and let us know what you've done.

   6)  Mobs should not be loaded with default positions of swimming, flying or
       levitating. Instead, they should be given AFF_FLY, AFF_LEVITATE,
       CAN_SWIM, CAN_FLY, CAN_LEVITATE.

   7)  If you want mobs that are sentinal to hunt..rather then have THEM
       hunt, add helper mobs...protector mobs, and give THOSE mobs ONLY the
       hunt flag. Those mobs that are sentinal wont start to leave their post.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
                      AN EXAMPLE MOB ENTRY WITH COMMENTS
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Example of a Sample Mob :

#XX00
guard city cityguard~
the cityguard~
A strong and trustworthy cityguard is standing here.
~
He stands about six feet tall and looks very tough.  His commitment to his
work is readily apparent in his eyes.
~
72 16384 3 1000 S
H 1 0
10 5 -2 1d10+300 4d4+3
999 3000
8 8 1

Explanation of the example :

The first row is a list of all the keywords someone can use when attacking,
socializing with a mob.  The second is the Short Name, used in many places,
battle for one, in which you would see, Johnny hits the cityguard very hard.
The third is the Long Name, which is what you see when you walk in a room with
the mob in it.  The fourth is the mob desc.

His ACT flag is 72, which was arrived at by adding 8 (ISnoPC) and 64 (StayZone)
His AFFECT1 flag is 16384, which is just one flag,
His AFFECT2 flag is 3, which is 2 flags, (armor) and (bless)
The fourth number is 1000, which is his alignment (1000 = totally good)
The capital S is always there, in every mob, its just an internal flag

The next line is H (Humanoid), 1 for Hometown (Waterdeep) (0 for normal mobs),
and the final value is 0 (Another internal flag, always there).

The next line: He is level - 10, THAC0 - 5 (Hitroll), -2 for AC ( 10 to -10 ),
               Hitpoints are 1d10+300, and Damage rolls of 4d4+3

The next line is 999, which is how much gold he has, and 3000, his Experience

The final line is 8 8 1, Meaning he is standing normally, standing after
attacked, and is a male (1)

                         IV. THE OBJECT FILE (.OBJ)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Objects are stored in the .obj file. Loads of these objects occurs once at
MUD boot time, then repops will load additional objects dependant on various
parameters discussed in the ZONE FILE such as max numbers of objects and the
percentage load of those items.

Format of the Object File:
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
#<virtual number>
<namelist>~
<short description>~
<long description>~
~
<type flag> <extra flag> <wear flag>
<value 0> <value 1> <value 2> <value 3>
<weight> <value> <cost/day> <saff1> <saff2>
<extra description fields>
<object affect fields>
   <object affect sub-fields (if affect exists)>
'$~'

Explanation of the Object File Fields:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
#<virtual number>
   See rules for rooms and mobs above.

<namelist>~
   Same as for monsters, these are the words use when handling the item,
   for taking or grabbing it. Note that the first word in this list should
   be the most "proper" keyword for the item, as it is shown when you sell
   the item, etc. An example would be a fine leather cloak with keywords:
   cloak leather fine in that order. It is also desirable for you to use
   material types as keywords.

   Special note for liquid containers: When using keywords for ITEM_DRINKCON
   objects, be sure to use the liquid type as the first keyword. This is
   because when a liquid container is emptied, it removes the first liquid
   keyword, later replacing it by the next liquid type it is filled with.
   Thus, a waterskin should have keywords: water waterskin skin, for example.
   Then, if the skin were emptied and later filled with milk, its keywords
   would become: milk waterskin skin.

<short description>~
   This string will be displayed when the object is used. For example
   if it is "a rubber raft", and a player drops it, then a message like:
   "Monthly drops a rubber raft."
   could be displayed.

<long description>~
   This description is displayed when the object is lying on the ground.
   For example, if it is "A furled umbrella lies here.~" then this message
   is displayed when the umbrella is lying on the ground. Since the endings
   for long descriptions have tended to be rather monotonous, the following
   is a varied list of suggested endings:

   Examples: Such and such lies here, lies here discarded, lies discarded
   here, has been laid aside here, has been cast aside here, rests here, has
   been dumped here, has been thrown away here, lies abandoned here, etc.
   You should generally avoid using on the ground, on the road or other such
   specific terrains as it'd look funny if the object were dropped on the
   Elemental Plane of Fire, for example.

   These values are very central. They define the ability of items based on
   the items <item type>. These values are defined below and differ for each
   type of item. Note that if you define an item as being anything but a
   weapon, you shouldn't set the 'wield' flag. Many similar obvious rules
   apply.

   <contents> indicates that the contents MUST be entered.

   [contents] indicates that the contents can OPTIONALLY be entered.

          The above values for drunkenness/fullness/thirst are used per
          four "units" drunk. The values are expressed in HOURS!

            His Fullness increases by ((7/4)*1) hours
            His Thirst increases by ((7/4)*-2) hours, thus making

          The hours above are numbers between 0 and 24. 24 hours is
          maximum for drunkenness/fullness/thirst. When hours are zero

<extra description fields>
   Extra descriptions are used to provide additional information about an
   object if a person looks at the object. Note that these are a required
   field for objects. Use this place to describe the object, hint at its
   uses/abilities, rationalize the object's existance, etc.

      <extra description sub-fields>
       The sub-fields for the extra description field follow the following
       format:

         'E'
         <extra description keyword list>~
         <description>
         ~

      E
      You must always put a capital E preceeding the extra description.

      <extra description keyword list>~
         These are the words which will allow the extra description to be
         seen. The words the player will look at to see the object's
         description. These keywords must be seperated by blank spaces.

      <description>
         This is the description displayed when a player types 'look at
         <keyword>' which matches one of the words on the keyword list
         above. Follow the lines of text with a ~ on a line by itself
         (as shown in the format above).


<object affect fields>
   Between zero and two "affect's" may be set on an item. The affects could
   for example modify a characters strength, height etc. The affect only goes
   into affect when the character wear, wield or hold the item. The affect
   is removed when the character removes the items. If an affect is desired
   for an object, the following sub-fields may be inserted into the object's
   format:


      'A'
      <location> <modifier>
      'A'
      <location> <modifier>

         'A'
          When items are worn using wear/wield/grab/hold commands, the 'A' will
          allow the items to affect a characters various abilities. Currently
          a maximum of 2 'A' are allowed.

          <location>
           <location> is one of the below numbers, indicating which ability
           will be changed.

           APPLY_NONE       0 * DO NOT USE.

           APPLY_DAMROLL   19 * The bonus/penalty to damage the opponent.
           APPLY_SV_PARA   20 * These five are saving throws.
           APPLY_SV_ROD    21 *
           APPLY_SV_PETRI  22 *
           APPLY_SV_BREATH 23 *
           APPLY_SV_SPELL  24 * This is the most used saving throw.
           APPLY_FIRE_PROT 25 * Item is immune to fire (not the mob)

           APPLY_KARMA     29 * Luck and karma are not see on the player's
           APPLY_LUCK      30 * stats, but the object will show these to
                                be modified.
           <modifier>
            The modifier is added to the APPLY_XXX ability of the character
            when he uses an item, and is subtracted when he stops using it.
            Take great care when using this. This is an example of an item of
            improve strength and armor class. Example:

               A
               1 2
               A
               17 -2

            This adds +2 to the strength, and adds -2 to the AC (thus improving
            it). No more 'Affects is allowed at this time.

            CREATION STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR THE OBJECT FILE
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
   You must follow these guildlines if you plan on making a zone for Duris.
   Creating areas can be a rather simple process. The primary element
   necessary is time to add together all the flags and compile the
   oodles of little elements to create the final whole.  Following these
   guidelines throughout your zone will improve its design, solve many
   errors, and make the creation of the zone go more smoothly. Furthermore,
   these guidelines often have purposes such as maintaining mud balance and
   playability which are essential in upkeeping Duris's quality.

   1)  Short item descriptions should begin with an indefinite article (a
       blue cape, some stretch pants). Reasonable exceptions will usually
       be for items which should be unique (The Balor's whip, Sting).
       In these cases, it would be best to call them, a dagger named, 'Sting'

   2)  Use new features of Duris. There are a number of unique things
       in Duris, but people won't necessarily know if they aren't used.
       Read on for more specifics on what these are.

   3)  A note on numbering: It is helpful to number your items, rooms, and
       mobs using an odd letter-prefix, such as "QQ" so that we can move your
       stuff to any section of the world file. Start at "QQ00" in each file
       and move up from there. If you exceed 100 entries, use another prefix
       to indicate that, and let us know what you've done.

    4) Be careful about making items which are too powerful. Items should
       make sense in relation to the place/mob where they are found (in other
       words, items do not exit purely to satisfy the needs of players), and
       have power commensurate to the difficulty in obtaining it. It is also
       suggested that most magic or otherwise powerful items have downsides
       in order to even things out - a sword which can hit for a lot of damage
       might be too heavy to carry much else, or lower constitution by a point
       or two. (An amendment to this, showing relative strength of items and
       mobs is on a list of possible additions to this document). Additional,
       more specific, object guidelines areto be found below.

    5) Do not use dice with 100 sides or more - it's hard to tell just
       which side is on top when we roll them. Also, no one- or zero-sided
       dice - they just don't seem to make those anymore.

    6) All objects should have extra descriptions. Extra descriptions are
       generally a quick thing to add and they end up providing a great deal
       of flavor for the MUD. The use of extra descriptions can be used to
       hint at a zone's theme, describe strange properties of the item, and
       explain more what the area creator invisioned with the item.

    7) Container guidelines:
       Consider the following typical values and rules for any containers
       you make.

          Typical Containers:
          -------------------
          a typical small bag/sack holds around 30 lbs
          a typical large bag/sack holds around 50 lbs
          a typical small backpack holds around 75 lbs
          a typical large backpack holds around 120 lbs
          a typical small belt pouch holds around 15 lbs
          a typical large belt pouch holds around 25 lbs
          *See the standard object list at the end of the docs for more
           examples.

          Magical Containers:
          -------------------
          Magical versions of containers can have higher maxhold values,
          so long as the object makes sense and is suitablly difficult to
          obtain. The problem arises when objects are given negative
          values for weight, in order to simulate bags of holding and
          such. Follow a couple of simple rules here and remember than
          any abnormal containers should be very rare in order to keep them
          a special feature of the game.

          *the negative value of weight should never be larger than the
          mxhold, although they can be equal

          *pouches, belts, and other "small" items should not exceed
          -100 lbs in weight, larger items such as bags, backpacks,
          robes, etc should not exceed -300 lbs in weight

    8) Weapon Guidelines:

        Typical Common Weapons: Your typical weapons will range in damage
        dice from 1d4 (daggers), 1d6 (maces/staves/short swords), 1d8 (long
        swords, battle axes) to 1d10 (pole arms). Common two-handed weapons,
        will be about double these values. Inferior weapons can be slightly
        lower in dice and better quality weapons could be like a 2d2 dagger.

        High Quality Weapons: Higher quality weapons can have maximum damages
        up to the limits listed below:

          Max     Weapon style
          ---     ------------
          6       Daggers, darts, staves
          8       Clubs, fighting staves
          10      Short Swords, MorningStars
          12      Long Swords, general polearms
          20      Hand-and-a-Half swords (Single handed weapons which cannot be
                                          Dual wielded)
          32      Two-Handed swords

        Weapon Minuses/Plues on To-Hit and Damage: Items which have modifiers
        to their to-hit roll or damage, in general should be flagged MAGIC or
        BLESS or have some hint in their extra description which clarifies
        the objects powers. Minuses/Pluses will vary between one and five.
        Note that inferior weapons will generally not have modifiers, but
        rather poor dice for damage (like a 1d2 dagger).

    9) Object Value Guidelines and Examples:

        Monetary values for treasure and equipment have general guidelines
        which should be followed. The chart below lists some relative "wealth
        categories" from poor to extraordinarily rich. When assigning a value
        for an object, base your choice on the examples given below. Using them
        as best approximations to the value your object should have. Note that
        all values are given in COPPER pieces, with 1pcoin(PP) = 10gcoin(GP) =
        100scoin(SP) = 1000ccoin(CP) Obviously, there is a great deal of
        fluxtuation in object quality, presentation, location, etc. which will
        vary object value.

        Category One - Poor Wealth:

   10) Number of Items:

        In general, only the most powerful of mobs should have more than two
        or three items on them (notable exception is shopkeepers). Mobs,
        cannot carry full sets of equipment and maintain a mud balance, thus
        that aspect of realism cannot be allowed.

   11) To-hit and Damage Equipment, Other Stat Equipment:

        Non-weapon equipment which affects damage or to-hit rolls should be
        typically ONLY +1 or +2 maximum. Equpment which affects saves should
        be limited to +1 or +2, while stat eq should not exceed +8.

   12) Ac Notes:

        Items worn on fingers or ears ignore ac-apply. Held items and items
        worn on the eyes should not be given ac-apply. Think of ac-apply as
        indicative of material properties of the item (size, weight, structure,
        material type, etc.) while affects ac shows any magical properties
        of the item. Some guideline max values are given below, based on both
        armor make and how much body area it covers:

                    AN EXAMPLE OBJECT ENTRY WITH COMMENTS
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Example item for reference :

#XX00
sword long~
a long sword~
A long sword lies here.~
~
5 0 8193
0 1 6 3
10 350 1

Explanation of the example :

#XX00 is used for the item numbers, number them XX00, XX01, etc.

sword long~ is the key list, the words used when "wielding", "taking" the item.

a long sword~ is the Short Name, what you see in your inv or when wearing the
  item.

A long sword lies here. is the Long Name, used when the item is on the ground.

~   <---- Must ALWAYS be there, its an internal flag.

5 0 8193 <-- 5 is ITEM_TYPE weapon, 0 is the <extra flag> (In this case none
             are used), and 8193 is ITEM_TAKE (1) added with ITEM_WEAPON (8192)

0 1 6 3 is the Values line, which is unique for every Item Type, a long list
        of what these values are for each item type is at the end of this doc.
        in this case, 0 is not used (Value 0), 1 and 6 mean the sword does 1d6
        damage (Values 1-2), and 3 is item "slashes" (Value 3)

Format of the zone-file:

<weather table - wind direction>
<weather table - precipitation>
<weather table - temperature>
<command table>
<command>
.
.
.
<command>
'S'

Explanation of the Zone File Fields:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
#<virtual number>
   This is the zone vnum, use XX unless an Implementor assigns you a
   number value.

<name>~
   This is the name of the zone.

<top of zone>
   This is the top room of the zone, the highest number room in your zone.

<life span>
   This value is the life span of the zone and tells the game when to reset
   or repop the zone. The life span is a value in real minutes. When the
   age of the zone, since last reset, reaches this value the zone is queued
   for reset. Then the zone is reset ass soon as posible, depending on the
   conditions of the zone reset mode below.

<reset mode>
   The reset mode determines the conditions which will allow the zone to
   reset or repop once its life span has expired. This may take on one of
   three values:

      0: Never reset the zone, regardless of life span. In this case, the
         age of the zone is never queued for rest, thus the value for life
         span is effectively ignored.

      1: This value will reset the zone as soon as there are no players left
         in any of its rooms. Also called no pc repop by some.

     2: Reset the zone immediately no matter who are what is in it.

   Note the significance of the zone life span and reset mode, especially
   with difficult zones repopping alot (just killed the dragon and resting?
   here have another one 5 second later) or newbie zones repoping too slow
   for people to want to spent time there. Typical values are 10-20 minute
   life spans for cities and newbie areas and 30-40 mins for high level zones,
   with low level zones reset mode 2 and high level zones reset mode 1 or
   possiblly 0 (rarely used).

<flag1>
   This flag can define the following features for the zone, which can be
   added together:

      ZONE_SILENT    1
      ZONE_SAFE      2
      ZONE_HOMETOWN  4

<season patterns>
   There are several season patterns available which designate how the year's
   seasons are divided in the region of the zone. You can choose from the
   following:

      ONE_SEASON                1    <------------1------------>
      TWO_SEASONS_EQUAL         2    <-----1------><-----2----->
      TWO_SEASONS_FIRST_LONG    3    <-------1-------><---2---->
      TWO_SEASONS_SECOND_LONG   4    <---1----><------2-------->
      THREE_SEASONS_EQUAL       5    <---1---><---2---><---3--->
      FOUR_SEASONS_EQUAL        6    <--1--><--2--><--3--><--4-->
      FOUR_SEASONS_EVEN_LONG    7    <-1-><---2---><-3-><---4--->
      FOUR_SEASONS_ODD_LONG     8    <---1---><-2-><---3---><-4->

   Note that the numbers in the right hand diagram refer to the columns in the
   weather tables explained below. For example, if your zone has two seasons,
   equally long, values for wind3, wind4, precip3, precip4 etc. will all be
   0, as that "season" does not exist. See weather table information below.

<flag2>
   This flag can define the following features for the zone, which can be
   added together:

      NO_MOON_EVER        1
      NO_SUN_EVER         2
      NON_CONTROLLABLE    4  *Weather can't be controlled by spells in the zone
      WHOLE_ZONE_INDOORS  8

<mana_add>
   The amount of mana regenerated in the zone, currently this has no meaning
   and is outdated DIKU information. In the future, it may have use with
   psionics...leave it 0 until told otherwise.


<weather table - wind>
   This line has four values, one for each of a posible four seasons:

   wind1 wind2 wind3 wind4

   Each of these four values should be filled in from the following table:

   Seasonal Wind Characteristics:
   ------------------------------
      SEASON_NON-EXISTANT  0
      SEASON_CALM          1
      SEASON_BREEZY        2

   Seasonal Wind Variations:
   -------------------------
      WIND CAN CHANGE DIRECTION      0
      WIND CAN NOT CHANGE DIRECTION  1

   This value won't matter if the season does not exist, so just use 0 for
   any unused seasons in the table.

<weather table - wind direction>
   This line has four values, one for each of a possible four seasons:

   winddir1 winddir2 winddir3 winddir4

   Each of these four values should be filled from the following table:

   This line has four values, one for each of a possible four seasons:

   precip1 precip2 precip3 precip4

   Each of these four values should be filled using the following table:

<command table>
   The following begins a command table, a series of commands to execute at
   mud boot and zone resets. The end of the table is terminated with a S and
   can contain multiple commands, one to a line, which can be repeated.

   Each command possibility consists of a letter, identifying the command
   type, followed by three or four arguements. The first argument, common to
   all the commands is called the <if-flag>, which can have a value of 0 or 1.
   if the value is 0, the command is always executed when called for. If the
   value is 1, the command is ONLY executed if the previous command was
   executed. Other information is contained with each command as shown below:

      M (TO Load a Mobile)
      --------------------
      Format: 'M' <if-flag> <mobile vnum> <max existing> <room vnum>

      This command loads a mobile in a room.

      <mobile vnum>  : The vnum of the mob to be loaded
      <max existing> : This specifies the maximum number of the mob which
                       can exist in the mud at one time. If the max number is
                       about to be exceeded, the command won't be executed.
                       If you only want one manifestation of a given monster,
                       just use the number 1.
      <room vnum>    : The vnum of the room that the mob is to be loaded into.

      O (TO Load an Object)
      ---------------------
      Format: 'O' <if-flag> <object vnum> <max existing> <room vnum>

      This command loads an object in a room. Note that most eq needs to be
      on a mob or in a non-takable container in order to prevent people from
      snatching the equipment up without having to kill the guardian etc.
      Obviously, there are exceptions but this is a zone makign tip.

      <object vnum>  : The vnum of the object to be loaded.
      <max existing> : This specifies the maximum number of the object which
                       can exist in the mud at one time.
      <room vnum>    : The vnum of the room that the object is to be loaded
                       into.

      G (TO Give an Object to a Mobile)
      ----------------------------------
      Format: 'G' <if-flag> <object vnum> <max existing>

      This command gives an object to the last monster referenced, that is,
      the last M command previous to this command in the command table. The
      object will then "load" in the monster's inventory.

      <object vnum>  : The vnum of the object to be loaded.
      <max existing> : This specifies the maximum number of the object which
                       can exist in the mud at one time.

      E (TO Equip a Mobile With an Object)
      ------------------------------------
      Format: 'E' <if-flag> <object vnum> <max existing> <equipment position>

      This command loads an object and places it in the worn equipment list
      of the last monster referenced, that is, the last M command previous to
      this command in the command table. Note that it is NOT necessary to
      precede this command with a 'G' command.

      <object vnum>        : The vnum of the object to be loaded.
      <max existing>       : This specifies the maximum number of the object
                             which can exist in the mud at one time.
      <equipment position> : This value determines where the object is equiped
                             on the mob. Use the values from the following
                             chart:

         WEAR_LIGHT           0 * Not imped

      P (TO Put an Object in Another Object)
      --------------------------------------
      Format: 'P' <if-flag> <object vnum1> <max existing> <object vnum2>

      This command loads object one and places it inside object two. Obviously,
      object two should be a container.

      <object vnum1> : The vnum of the first object to be loaded. (placed item)
      <max existing> : This specifies the maximum number of the first object
                       which can exist in the mud at one time
      <object vnum2> : The vnum of the second object to be loaded. (container)

      D (To Set the State of a Door)
      ------------------------------
      Format: 'D' <if-flag> <room vnum> <exit number> <door state>

      This command sets the state of the doors in a zone. Note that EACH side
      of the door must have a command in the table.

      <room vnum>   : The vnum of the room where this side of the door exists
      <exit number> : The direction of the exit, in this room. (Don't get the
                      different sides of the room confused!)
      <door state>  : Choose from the following:

         OPEN             0
         CLOSED           1
         CLOSED & LOCKED  2
          *Add 4 to the above for secret doors
           Add 8 to the above for blocked exits (See ITEM_SWITCH)

            CREATION STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR THE ZONE FILE
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Important Notes on making the .zon File:

1) Whatever you do, make SURE you comment your zone file.  You will see what
   we mean in the example below, but in brief, make sure that after every load
   you put in, write a comment after it to tell us (The Makers) what you are
   loading there.  This is a MUST, we will return the zone to you and tell you
   to comment it if you do not.

2) When you load a mob, the load looks like this: M 0 1234 5 9999
   Explanation: M 0 is always there, that tells the mud your loading a mob.
   The 1234 is the mob number, equal to the mob number in your .mob file.
   The 5 is the maximum number of that kind of mob in the world.  What this
   means is that There can be no more than 5 of mob #1234 in the world at any
   time.  If you choose 5 for this value, then there should be 5 mob loads
   in the zone table, not 1.  This number should = the number of loads you have
   for that mob in the .zon file, seen below.  The 9999 is the room number to
   which you are loading the mob.

3) Under NO circumstances are you to use any item or mob from another zone in
   your zone, UNLESS you first copy that object into you zone's files and
   renumber it to fit within your range..even this is frowned upon as we want
   you to make an original area. A notable exception to this are common,
   standardized items which may be found on a list later in these docs. Those
   items may be used anywhere you like, so long as you set the max existing
   value of those items high (99999) so they don't come into conflict with
   any other zones which will be using those same items.

4) Take care in assigning Temperature to the zone.  Freezing, Heatstroke and
   boiling all do damage every to a player.  Do NOT use those without a good
   reason.  (The Arctic would be freezing for example).

                        VI. THE SHOP FILE (.SHP)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
The shop file is used to make permanant shops or travelling shopkeepers and
salesmen. These files have several important features, such as:

        * Ability to have shop mobs that wander the world
        * Shop open and closing messages
        * Ability to allow a shopkeeper to stop/allow magic casting in their
          store
        * Setting of shopkeeper's hometown and race
        * Ability to make racist shopkeepers
        * Shops can produce up to 256 items
        * Shops can trade in 50 different item types
        * Shopkeepers list their items with corresponding numbers, so items
          can be bought by number or keyword

Creating a shop file is fairly complicated, so the format has been explained
in detail, section by section, below. Additionally, a couple of example
excerpts from working zones have been included at the end of this section.

Explanation of the Shop File Fields:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
#<shop number>~
   The beginning of each shop entry starts with a number sign (#) and then
   the number of the shopkeeper mob (this will also be the shop number). Note
   that this is NOT the number of the shop ROOM. This number must be followed
   by a tilde (~).

      EX:  #11524~

N
   On the next line, place a capital 'N'. Note that there is no tilde after
   this 'N'. The capital N marks the shop files as being in the 'new' format,
   since there will be no old format shops created, these are no longer
   explained.

<List of items produced by shop>
   Here is where you should list all of the items that this shop produces.
   That is, the items that a shopkeeper will never run out of, ones the
   players can buy repeatedly. List each of these items on a seperate line
   and when that list is complete, place a zero (0) on the next line.

      EX:  364      ------  Item one
           11528    ------  Item two
           398      ------  Item three
           399      ------  Item four
           11531    ------  Item five
           11563    ------  Item six
           0        <------ The zero denoting the end of the item list

<Multiplier for how much shopkeeper buys an item for>  (0.0 - 1.0)
   On this line, put in a decimal value that will indicate how much below
   object value the shopkeeper will be willing to pay for an item.

      EX: Assume a player has a sword which is worth 100 copper coins and that
      they sell it to a shopkeeper. This value will determine how much the
      shopkeeper will give the player for it. This value can range from
      0.1 to 1.0 and should not exceed 1.0, in general being < 1.0. The lower
      the value, the less the shopkeeper will pay for the item.

      0.5   <---- if the value were this, the shopkeeper would pay 50 copper
                  coins for the sword ( i.e. 0.5 X <item value> )

   Note that these values must have one decimal place, even if the number
   in an integer.

<Multiplier for how much profit shopkeeper gets when selling item> ( > 1.0)
   On this line, put in a decimal value that will indicate how much profit
   the shopkeeper will receive when they sell an item to a PC, or in other
   words how much an object will cost (displayed with list command).

      EX: Assume a player has the same sword as above, with a value of 100
      copper coins, that they buy from this shopkeeper. This value will
      determine how much the shop will sell the item for and its value can
      range from 1.0 and up. The higher the value, the more expensive the
      shopkeeper's items will be.

      1.5   <---- if the value were this, the shopkeeper would sell the
                  sword for 150 copper coins (i.e. 1.5 X <item value> )
   Note that these values must have one decimal place, even if the number
   in an integer.

<List of item types traded by shopkeeper>
   On the following lines, you will list all of the item types which the
   shopkeeper will buy. List each of these on a seperate line, followed
   by a zero (0) when you are done. You can put up to 50 different values
   here. The listing of object ITEM_TYPES has been reproduced below for your
   convience. If the shop doesn't buy anything, such as a bar, put just the
   zero (0) in this spot.

      EX:  5  ------ Item_Type Weapon
           9  ------ Item_Type Armor
           0  ------ Shows the end of the item types listing for this shop

   ITEM_LIGHT               1 * Item is a light.

<various shop messages>
   This section of the shop file containes seven lines of messages that the
   shopkeeper uses to interact with the players. Each message begins with a
   %s and ends with a tilde (~), with each message being on a seperate line.

   Format:
   %s Message used when a player tries to buy an item the shop does not have~
   %s Message used when player tries to sell an item they don't have~
   %s Message used when player tries to sell something the shop doesn't buy~
   %s Message used when player tries to sell an item which the shopkeeper
      cannot afford~
   %s Message used when player tries to buy an item they cannot afford~
   %s Message used when shopkeeper sells an item to a player %s~
   %s Message used when shopkeeper buys an item from a player %s~

   Note: The ending %s's on the last two lines are for coin messages and need
         to be included. The %s can be moved around within the body of the
         message wherever you want the number of coins for buy/sell to be
         displayed. For example, you could do the following:

     %s That'll be %s coins for that fine weapon, thanks for the business.~

   Also, these messages can only be ONE line long, with a tilde at the end.

   0
   0

   After the shop messages, the next two lines both have zeros (0) on them.
   These MUST be included.

<shopkeeper's mob number>
   This line contains the virtual number <mob vnum> of the shopkeeper. This
   is the same number which is used in the .mob file.

      EX:  11524  ------ This would be mob vnum 11524

   0

   The next line of the file contains a zero, this must be added and is the
   only thing on this line.

<shopkeeper's shop number - 0 if roaming>
   This line has one number, the number of the room where the shopkeeper sells
   their goods. It corresponds to the room number of the shop in the .wld
   file. If the shopkeeper roams, and has no permanant room they are in,
   put a zero (0) in for this value.

      EX:  11527  ------ This is the shopkeeper's room, room vnum 11527

<First opening time>
<First close time>
<Second opening time - 0 if not used>
<Second closing time - 0 if not used>
   These four values are used to determine when a shop is open and when it
   is closed. All of the times are listed in military time (0-23), and there
   are two possible opening and closing times. As an example, a shopkeeper
   could open at 6AM (6), close for lunch at noon (12), re-open at 1PM (13)
   and close for the night at 9PM (21). This shopkeeper would then have the
   collowing entry:

      EX:  6
           12
           13
           21

   Notes: For shops that stay open 24 hours a day, put a zero (0) in the
   first opening time and a twenty-eight (28) for the first close time.
   Then, the other two closing times would be zeros (0). Twenty-eight is
   used to indicate that the shope closes ont he 28th hours, i.e. never.

   If your shop only opens/closes once a day, make the second opening and
   closing times both zero.

<Flag - Does shop roam? Y = yes, N = No>
   This line determines whether or not the shop roams the world or is
   stationary within their place of business. Put a capital Y (yes) if the
   shop roams and a capital N (no) if it does not roam.

      EX:  N  ------ Thus, this shopkeeper does not roam


<Flag - Is shop NO_MAGIC? Y = Yes, N = No>
   This line is used to determine whether or not the shopkeeper allows
   players to use magic or cast spells within the shop. Put a capital Y
   (yes) if the shopkeeper does prevent magic use (no-magic) or a capital
   N (no) if the shopkeeper does allow magic to be cast.

      EX:  N  ------ Thus, this shopkeeper allows magic to be cast


<Flag - Is shopkeeper killable? Y = Yes, N = No>
   This line is used to determine whether or not the shopkeeper can be attacked
   by typing "hit shopkeeper" or "kill shopkeeper". Put a capital Y (yes)
   if the shopkeeper does prevent normal attack or a capital N (no) if the
   shopkeeper does not prevet normal attack and can be killed with hit/kill.

      EX:  N  ------ Thus, this shopkeeper can be attacked normally

<Opening message>~
   This is the message used when the shop opens for business and is spoken
   by the shopkeeper. Note that the end of the line must have a tilde (~)
   on it.

      EX:  I am now open for business~

<Closing message>~
   This is the message used when the shop closes for business and is spoken
   by the shopkeeper. Note that the end of the line must have a tilde (~)
   on it.

      EX:  I am closed, come back later!~

<hometown flag>
   Currently this flag is not used. Later it will be used to identify the
   town associated with shopkeepers, for now just make it zero (0).

      EX:  0  ------ Zero, not associated with any hometown for now.

<social action types>
    This flag is for Social Action Types. This flag is also not currently in
    use but, in the future, it will be used for the support of mobile
    interaction with other players. When in, this flag will determine how the
    shopkeeper responds to socials and actions directed against or at it. For
    now, just put in a 0.

<Flag - Is shopkeeper racist? Y = Yes, N = No>
   This line determines if the shopkeeper is a racist. If the shopkeeper is
   a racist, they will not deal with anyone but their own race. If this line
   is a capital Y (yes) the shopkeeper is a racist. If the line is a capital
   N (no), the shopkeeper is not a racist.

      EX:  Y  ------ Thus, the shopkeeper is a racist.

<Shopkeeper's race>
   This line defines the shopkeeper's race and uses the following values:

    Human.......1       Barbarian..........2     Drow Elf.........3

                        VII. THE QUEST FILE (.QST)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Format for quest mobs:
----------------------

Each qst mob starts with '#' and the mob id.  Follow
by any number of M or Q sub-format.  Each mob ends with
'S'.  '#~' to end the whole qst file.

---------------BEGIN QST FILE------------------------
#<mob 1 number>
[M or Q-format and can repeat any number of times in any order]
[M or Q-format and can repeat any number of times in any order]

-----------------END QST FILE--------------------


/----------------------------------------------------------------
| M-format:
| --------
| M
  <list of key words to trigger this message>~
  <message>
  ~

For example:
  M
  home scroll
  The guy says, 'Yes, I wan't to find my way home.
  Do you have a spare scroll to give me?'
  ~

Explanation:
When the player tell/ask this mob and the message contains
either 'home' or 'scroll', the mob will reply to player
with the above message.

/----------------------------------------------------------------
| Q-format:
| --------
| Q
  <message>
  ~
  [G or R-format and can repeat any number of times in any order]
  [D-format and can only appear once for each Q-format... if
   more than one D-format, then the last D-format is used]

For example:
  Q
  He says, 'Thank you for bringing this sword to me and giving me
  1000 gold coins.  For your generosity, I will teach you the secret
  of the spell 'resurrection'.  Here's a map to the inner dungeon.
  You may find it useful if you do decide to explore further into
  the dungeon.'
  ~
  R S <resurrection id>
  G I <sword id>
  G C 1000
  R I <map id>
  D
  Then he waves good-bye to you and disappears.
  ~
/----------------------------------------------------------------
  G-format:
  --------
  G I <item number>
  G C <number of coins>
  G T <item type>

/----------------------------------------------------------------
  R-format:
  --------
  R C <coin number>
  R I <item number>
  R S <skill/spell number>
  R E <experience pt value>

/----------------------------------------------------------------
  D-format:
  --------
  D
  <message>
  ~

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Note: If there is more than 1 G-format defined for the Q-format, then
    qst mob must have all the G-format items before it will release
    the quest message to the player.  For example, a mob quest is defined
    with 'G I 1234' and 'G C 5678'.  Then quest is only consider complete,
    if the mob has item #1234 and more than 5678 gold coins.

                         VIII. THE DURIS ANSI CODES
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Duris has several ANSI codes which can be used to add color to the long
descriptions, short descriptions, and extra descriptions of rooms, mobs and
objects. Note: Do NOT use these colors in the "keywords" listings, because
mortals cannot use ANSI codes, they will be unable to type those keywords. In
the future there may be "features" which use ANSI characters and keywords for
code recognition purposes. If so, those features will be added to these docs.

First things first.  The main thing to understand when using our version of
ansi color is:  you can SET things, or CLEAR ALL (back to white on black), but
you cannot just turn off bold, or blink.

There are 4 types of ansi control sequences:
&<N>|<n> -   reset everything, back to 'n'ormal (white on black).  This is also
             done for every newline, to eliminate 'bleed-through' colors.
&+<color> -  set foreground color.  If the color letter is uppercase, the BOLD
             (bright/light) bit is also set (and will STAY set) until either
             a newline, or &<N> is done.
&-<color> -  set background color.  If the color letter is uppercase, the BLINK
             bit will be set (same as for &+ above).
&=<bg><fg> - set both background <bg> and foreground <fg> color, exactly the
             same restrictions as for setting foreground and background
             seperately.

w - white    l - black    r - red    b - blue    g - green
y - yellow   c - cyan     m - magenta
(+w is normal text, +W is bold text)

Examples: &+GA bright green leaf juts out from the tree branch overhead.&N
          &=LRThis is flashing red on a black background.&N

                      IX. COMMAND AND SPELL USE CHARTS

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
                             COMMAND LIST CHART
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Below is a list of all the commands on the mud, and how to calculate what
they are.  This is just for a more general working information on how
Duris works, and is not used for making zones/areas.

To get a command number: Find the command in the lists, multiply its row
number by 7 and then add its collumn number to it. (R * 7 + C)

e.g. give is in row 10, collumn 2, thus: 10 * 7 + 2 == 72

may be some yet unseen problems with this table]

                  X. A LIST OF NUMBERS FOR SOME COMMON OBJECTS
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
The following common objects are standardized for use on Duris Mud. You may
use any of these object numbers in your .zon, .shp or .qst file to make use
of that particular object. DO NOT make copies of these objects in your .obj
files! These objects were made so that multiple, redundant copies of often
used objects could be eliminated. For example, if you want to put some iron
rations on your town's shopkeeper, just use Object #364 instead of making
your own iron rations. You are of course encouraged to come up with your own
original objects, but this large list should provide you with multitudes of
common objects to flesh out your zone and save you valuable creation time.

Note: Objects marked with "--" have been added to the mud so far and they
have extra descriptions. Objects marked with "-" are on the mud but do not
have extra descriptions. Unmarked objects have not yet been added to the
standard objects list in the mud's files. Objects which can be created with
the minor creation spell are marked with MC.
