power~
At the mere mention of power the towering creature focuses its soul-penatrating
gaze in your direction.  A deep rumbling snicker emanates from within your mind
as the demon invades your thoughts... 'Foolish mortal.  How could a mere person
such as yourself help Rozkadrath, ambassador of Joukarth Forgath in his quest
for power?'
~
M
help~
The demons eyes glow deep violet as it looks upon you, giving no hint as to
whether it would like to destroy you or entertain your questions... again your
mind is filled with its words... 'Hah!  If indeed you wish to help me in my
search, your reward will be great indeed mortal.  I am Rozkadrath, ambassador of
Joukarth Forgath, keeper and ruler of the 400th layer of the Abyss, punisher of
the damned.  The Nalfeshnee ruler has declared a war with the Balors and require
lost relics and components for a spell which will guarentee our victory over the
pitiful creatures.  I have been able to locate a few reagents, as the foolish
conjurer who summoned me was a collector of such things which my master
requires, but I am running out of time as the war is deeply under way.  If you
will assist his lordship in this task, I assure you you shall become more
powerful than any mortal has ever dreamed.  Can you assist me in this task?'
~
M
yes~
You feel a dark wave of energy pass over you as the dark voice rumbles within
your head 'Excellent.  Although I am sure you will assist Joukarth most
valiantly in his quest for dominance, I shall require you to prove your
obedience to my master before I trust you with such a an important task.  There
is a great many-armed demon who dwells within the Hell plane who is known to
possess great power.  I require the items of power which he possesses.  Bring me
these and Rozkadrath shall reward you'.  As quickly as they came, your mind is
freed from the demonic whispers.
~
Q
As you place the items before the demon a large flame erupts from the ground,
engulfing them in a blaze of hellfire.  As Suddenly as it came, the fire is
exstinguished.  A small circle of smoldering embers line the now barren earth
before you.  The demon's eyes focus on your head as the dominating voice plagues
your mind once again... 'Excellent mortal.  I see that you may infact possess
the power required to assist Joukarth in his quest.  Although I am not a master
of the arcane magics like my master Joukarth is, I do understand the inner
workings of the spell which he wishes to invoke.  It is elemental in nature, and
thus requires reagants which are pure and flawless.  Retrieve for me an earring
of solidified lightning and a cloak of swirling mists, its keeper being the one
who cannot be seen.  Take this seal as proof that you represent his highness
Joukarth Forgath and return it also to me when you have obtained the first of
the required reagents.  Go now mortal.'

Q
The demon's light up as he receives the relics of Yan-C-Bin, keeper of the
plane of air.. the first of the reagents requested by the glabrezu.  'I am
pleased with you mortal..' your mind throbs as it is invaded by the demon's
words 'and I am sure Joukarth will also be pleased to know that I have obtained
the first component for the spell.  Although a great task, your quest has only
just begun...' suddenly your mind is twisted... all that you see begins to swirl
and change before you... visions of horror fill your head... your thoughts seem
to disappear as quickly as they came... you can see only one thing...
Nightmares.  'The keeper of the nightmares possesses that which my master
requires.  Retrieve this and you shall be rewarded.'

Q
A small grin forms across the beast's face, its fangs dripping blood onto the
floor beneath it.  'Ah, the ethereal components... well done mortal.  His
highness Joukarth Forgath gives to you his thanks for your previous service to
our cause.  I am sure this display of obedience will further your likeness in my
master's eyes.  None the less we still require more of your assistance in our
quest.  The flames of the Abyss grow brighter as each of of the reagents are
brought together and I feel our power growing stronger with each minute.  The
next components my lord requests of me is that of a liquid form.  Seek the
protector of those who dwell among the water for our next reagents mortal.  Go
now.'  The voice quickly dissipates from within your head and you find yourself
again in reality.

Q
'Well done!' your head rumbles as the remenants of the elemental plane of water
are placed before Rozkadrath. 'Your powers amaze me mortal.  For such tasks to
be completed with such persistance you will surely rewarded beyond your wildest
dreams.'  For a second your thoughts are your own... dreams of riches, power,
and artifacts fill your head.  Empires under your control... more wealth than
one could ever spend in their lifetime... then all is gone and the voice once
again controls your mind... 'The components of the elemental plane of water will
surely please his highness, however, the fires of the abyss do burn every so
brightly and its flames will not embrace these reagants warmly.  I require a
relic with regenerative powers which will preserve the inegrity of the delicate
reagants.  Seek for me the necklace of the one who sits on a throne of water.
Go now mortal.'

Q
As you hand over the prized necklace of the ruler of the kingdom of the sea,
Poseidon, the demon flashes you a quick grin.  Your mind twists and your
thoughts contort as the being invades you yet again 'Wonderful mortal!  It seems
Poseidon proved to be less than formidable against your powers.  Well done
indeed.'  You grab your head as you feel waves of pain seep through your mind.
Again the beast rumbles 'A living fire is needed to meld the components
together... seek for me the items of fire which one can wear and not be burned.
The Prince of Fire holds that which will assist us next.  Return quickly and be
rewarded.'
~
G I 31549
Q
The demon takes the remains of Imix, prince of all fire elementals from you and
gives a slight nod.  'The fires of the Abyss shall burn ever so intensly now.
Joukarth gives you his personal thanks for your relentless efforts and only
wishes he could be here to show you his appreciation.'  Your head booms as the
being speaks within the confines of your mind 'The incantation is almost
complete... yes I can sense it is near.. and you too shall share in our glorious
victory over the balor rulers.  There is a fallen demon who has escaped the
confines of the Abyss and has assembled a group of minions in his quest for
mortal domination.  He wears upon his head a helmet crafted from a skull which
glows ever so brightly... this is the next of the components my lord Joukarth
seeks.  Return it for him and the power shall be yours.'  The haze of confusion
leaves your mind as the demon releases your thoughts.

Q
Rozkadrath laughs as you hand him the helmet of the demon prince Demogorgon
'Fool!  Did he think he could evade our forces forever?  Hah!'  Your head is
silent for a moment as the glabrezu examines the reagent.  Once again his
thundering voice fills your mind 'Young mortal, this brings great pleasure to
Joukarth, and I assure you the riches you shall receive are greater than you can
every conceive.  It has been a long road indeed, however we have come to the
requirement of the final ingredients.'  A soft chuckle can be heard by the demon
as he speaks his words in your mind 'You have proved to be quite strong indeed,
however, let us see how smart you are.  The final reagent my lord requires to
complete the incantation is that of the elemental plane of earth... but this
will require reagents of both a solid and crushed state.  I know it is alot to
ask for, but this shall be the last my lord requires of your services, and all
the power and riches promised by him shall be yours.  Go quickly mortal and
return to me the final reagents.'  The remenants of the voice still lingering,
you fade back into reality, the final task before you.

Q
As you hand over the bountiful treasure from the plane of earth, the powerful
posessions of the earthen lords Entemoch and Ogremach, a large grin forms on
Rozkadrath's dog-faced mouth.  Your mind begins to tremble..
SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAMS are the only sounds you hear as your mind
is taken over by the demon 'Hahahaha!  Foolish mortal!  With the final reagents
in our hands the portal to the prime plane can now be opened and Joukarth's
domination can begin!  Pray to your god mortal, for now is the beginning of the
end of all life, and the reign of Joukarth Forgath is here!  Attempt to
challenge his power and you shall be smitten where you stand.  Like the foolish
conjurer who summoned me from within the depths of the abyss, yours too shall be
his fate.  Come if you will to the island of darkness... come mortal.. to your
destiny.'  Swirling gasses begin to form around the glabrezu and a swealtering
heat blazes your skin.  A large portal opens before the demon and dissipates
quickly as he enters it.
