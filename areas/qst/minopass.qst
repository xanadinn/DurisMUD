   &+Ladventurer, come closer, much closer!  You have made your way
   &+Lthrough the mountains this far, yes? I see many adventurers come
   &+Lthrough here, but they do not enter the grate without a special
   &+Ckey&+L that only I can give to them.!&N'

   &+LNahasp laughs for a moment and peers at you.

   &+LNahasp &Nlooks at you and examines you briefly, stepping from side to
   side eyeing up your whole being.

   Finally, &+LNahasp&N speaks '&+LI see that you are strong and worthy of
   &+Lgoing through the tunnels that lie deep within this mountain, into the
   &+Lheart of the world.  I will give you the &+Ckey &+Lto this grate if
   &+Lyou if you bring for me &+W10 platinum coins&+L.  Where will you find
   &+Lthat kind of currency in this mountain?  In the pockets of the other
   &+Ladventurers you will slay on the mountain!!'

   &+LNahasp &Ncackles with insane glee for a moment, and fades back into the
   &+Ldark corner of the cave.
