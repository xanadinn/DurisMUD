Yes! My Mithril!  The filthy surface dwelling Dwarves wanted my Mithril!

But he showed them!  They came in, and woke the WraithLord!  Now look what
has happened!  I have no more mithril to ply my trade.  And what's worse,
someone has stolen my hammer!  What I wouldn't give to see my forge hot
once again.
