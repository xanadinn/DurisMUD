hi hello howdy greetings begin ready~
$n &+ggrins wildly, "Hello adventurer. My name is &+GB&+gurbu&+Gl and I
&+Gspeciali&+gze in information, and I have lots of it! Since you are new h&+Gere I will
&+Gprovide &+gyou with some much needed information if you are to have any &+Gchance of
&+Gsurvivin&+gg in this Realm. Firstly, you must understand that although t&+Ghere are
&+Gmany pla&+gces in the world that are vastly beautiful and breathtaking, &+Gyou must
&+Galso be &+gaware that there are things lurking around every corner that &+Gwill try
&+Gto kill &+gyou if you are not wholly prepared."

&+G"While t&+galking with people in this area, many words will be &+Wemphasized&+G. There
&+Gwill be &+ghelp files available for those key words to give you more inf&+Gormation
&+Gif you n&+geed it."

&+G"I will &+gprovide you with information as well, just &+Wask &+GB&+gurbu&+Gl&N &+Winfo&+G."

&+G"Oh! Bef&+gore I forget! If you get lost and need a map of this area, I &+Gcan give

&+Ggoing to&+g be friendly. Sometimes you will run into people who are not.&+G Even some
&+Gwhose cla&+gss has the ability to &+Wdisguise&+g themselves as other people or&+G even
&+Gcreature&+gs. And it is not unusual for people who are on your same side&+G to
&+Gattempt &+gto steal or even kill you. While this is not illegal behavior&+G in the
&+Grealm of&+g Duris, it is frowned upon as our war should be against the e&+Gvil races.
&+GBut even&+g so, players are encouraged to settle their own disputes and &+Gnot to

&+G"Many ad&+gventurers do not always like to travel alone in Duris. As was&+G said
&+Gbefore, &+gthere are many dangers. If a player asks you to group with th&+Gem they
&+Gwill lik&+gely ask you to &+Wf/c&+g, or &+Wfollow&+g and &+Wconsent&+g them. If you use th&+Gese
&+Gcommands&+g with the player's name as a parameter, you will begin to fol&+Glow them

&+chaving a wee &+Wsleep&+c  can help you heal and regenerate  your movement faster than
&+cstanding alone. Some towns and areas even have doctors or special healing rooms
&+cthat can help getting you back to full health! Heck, I had even stumbled across
&+ca magical fountain a few times out in the wilderness, have a drink or two. YUM!

hi hello howdy greetings begin ready~
&+mThe beautiful &+WSorceress&n &+Mgets a star look in her eye and&+m says, "It's wonderful
&+mfor you to have come.  &+MMy divinations showed me you would &+mbe here today."

&+mShe nods and begins t&+Mo smile, "Let us get started then."

&+m"Sorcerers are ofte&+Mn called upon to make things which would s&+meem impossible
&+mto many, merely ordi&+Mnary.  Because there is great potential &+mfor misuse, we
&+mmust instruct careful&+Mly and ensure that the power of the sp&+mells you learn
&+mare not beyond your ca&+Mpability to control and use effectiv&+mely,.  I can tell
&+myou more about the foll&+Mowing things:

  &+W-&+MSpells: Practicing and Scribing
  &+W-&+MCasting and memorization
  &+W-&+MCircles
  &+W-&+MInnates
  &+W-&+MSpecializations
  &+W-&+MTips
~
M
spell spells scribing scribe practicing practice~
&+mThe &+MSorceress&+m smiles and no&+Mds at you, and begins a &+mlong speech about spells.
&+m"Your spells can be destru&+Mctive, informative, curati&+mve, or debilitating
&+mdepending on how you use &+Mthem.  We will go over how t&+mo &+Wpractice&+m and &+Wscribe&N
&+ma spell now. Take your s&+Mpellbook and quill and hold bo&+mth of them in your hands.

&+m"After you hold your spell&+Mbook and quill you will ne&+med to &+Wrest&+m comfortably.
&+mNow practice the spells whi&+Mch you wish to have acce&+mss to into your book by
&+musing the &+Wpractice&+m command f&+Mollowed by the spell n&+mame. The &+Wscribe&+m skill works
&+mmuch the same as practice but&+M is done by copying &+manother spellbook. It can be
&+myours or another one you've fo&+Mund or borrowed from &+manother mage.  Spells that
&+mare available for you to copy a&+Mre listed under &+mthe &+Wspells&+m command or the
&+Wpractice&+m command when a teacher &+Mis present."

$n &+mleans &+Mcloser&+m and whispers into your ear, "Try
&+Wpractice all&+m, when your in the prese&+Mnce&+m of a teacher. It will copy all spells
&+mavailable to you into the book your h&+Mo&+mlding!"
~
M
casting cast memorization memorize mem~
$n &+Msays, "To cast a spell,&+m you'll have studied it and
&+mcommitted it to memory be&+Mforehand. To commit spells t&+mo memory you must first be
&+Wresting&+m and have your sp&+Mellbook be accessible either i&+mn your  inventory, hands,
&+mor attached to your bel&+Mt. After that, simply &+Wmemorize&+m the spells that you wish.
&+mEach spell you memoriz&+Me will be added to your repertoire&+m of spells.  All spells
&+mare assigned a &+Wcircle&+M level and the higher the level the &+mlonger it will take to
&+mcommit to memory fro&+Mm your  repertoire.  Each time you cas&+mt  a  spell the spell
&+mwill return to your&+M repertoire and will need to be memorize&+md again. If you wish
&+mto swap out a spell&+M from your repertoire  you will need t&+mo  first  &+Wforget&+m that
&+mspell to replace it.

&+m"Once you have a spell&+M or a list of spells in your re&+mpertoire you may want to
&+mgo into a meditation. &+WMeditation&+M is a skill of users o&+mf magic and whose benefit
&+mhelps reduce the amount &+Mof time you will need to memo&+mrize spells by up to half.
&+mMeditation is a highly mi&+Mnd consuming task however a&+mnd can easily be broken if
&+myou lose concentration."

&+mWhen you have finished memor&+Mizing your spells and&+m your studies are complete you
&+mnow are ready to &+Wcast&+m one of &+Mthem at your leisur&+me. To cast a spell you must be
&+mstanding and you will need to &+Minclude the spell&+m name enclosed in &+Wapostrophes&+m
&+mlike this: &+Wcast 'minor creation' bandage&+M.  If &+myou don't recall which spells you
&+mhave memorized you can use the &+Wmemorize&+M comm&+mand, after all you are a novice.
~
M
circles spellcircle~
$n &+Mnods and tells you, "&+mSpells are granted in &+Wcircles
&+mof specific power.   A&+Ms you grow in power, you wil&+ml be granted new circles of
&+mspells to memorize an&+Md cast.  Within each circle, yo&+mu will be granted a certain
&+mnumber of spell slots&+M  which indicate the number of s&+mpells you can hold in your
&+mrepertoire.  To switc&+Mh from one spell to another, yo&+mu use the &+Wforget&+m command to
&+mremove it from your rep&+Mertoire. To forget everythin&+mg you have memorized you can
&+Wforget all&+m. Once you hav&+Me forgotten a spell you ma&+my memorize another spell from
&+mthe same circle in its pl&+Mace."
~
M
innate innates~
$n &+msays, "Just use the &+Winnate&+m command and it will
tell you what abilities the &+YG&+yo&+wd&+Ls&+m have blessed your race or chosen path with."

&+m"What else would you like to know?"
~
M
specialization specializations spec specs~
&+mThe &+MSorceress&n &+mbites her lip &+Mand looks around, mak&+ming sure that nobody else is
&+maround to hear.  "I proba&+Mbly should not be telling y&+mou about this so early, but
&+myou seem like a smart s&+Mtudent.  You can choose to spec&+mialize on a specific
&+mpath when you have gaine&+Md a sufficient amount of expe&+mrience.  As a sorcerer you
&+mhave three paths open to &+Myou:

&+MWild&+mmage
&+LShadow&+wmage
&+LWizard

&+m"Each of these focuses on a diffe&+Mrent aspe&+mct of sorcery.  Study each of them
&+mfor when you make your choice, you&+M will w&+mant it to be the correct one for you."
~
M
tip tips suggestions~
&+mThe &+MSorceress&+m looks a b&+Mit tired from all the inst&+mruction and sits down
&+mon her wooden stool an&+Md looks at you seriously for&+m a moment.  "Remember that
&+myour power comes at t&+Mhe price of intellectual study&+m.  You will want to avoid
&+mcontact with the bruti&+Msh and barbaric types that w&+mould use crude weapons of
&+msteel and wood to injur&+Me their opponents.  Use yo&+mur spells from a distance
&+mand always be prepared t&+Mo retreat.  Guile and cu&+mnning can be more deadly than
&+mbrute force in many situa&+Mtions."

quest quests~
$n &+wsighs sadly and turns your way&N, "You think you are
ready for a quest so soon?  Well then, there is something you could do to help
me and the other mages out. Recently some &+Ldark &+mmagical&+L stones&N were taken from
the &+Cm&+cag&+Ce&N tower.  Without these &+Lstones&N our powers are weakened.  Our last scout

&+cThe &+CAlc&+chem&+Cist&+c looks up and smiles, "Well hello to you, so glad you&n
&+chave joined us. Have a seat and lets get busy working, we have a lot&n
&+clot of ground to cover!&n

&+CAlc&+chem&+Cists&+c are a unique class. We do damage by throwing potions that&n
&+cwe mix from ingredients we forage. Sound confusing? We'll lets take it&n
&+cstep by step. Which do you want to learn about first?&n

&+C-foraging&n
&+C-mixing potions&n
&+C-throwing potions&n
&+C-crafting equipment&n

&+c"When you feel ready to depart this area, make sure to come back and &n
&+cask me about a &+Wquest&n &+cto see if you are ready.&n
~
M
fffffff~
  &+cThe &+CAlc&+chem&+Cist&+c grins, "Well time to get our hands dirty...&n

  &+cTo gain ingredients for mixing potions you need to &+YFORAGE&+c. It is&n
&+cpretty easy, you go to almost any outdoor room an use the &+Wforage&+c command.&n
&+cThe ingredients are random though you will get more of certain types in&n
&+cdifferent terrains. You can use the &+Wterrain&+c command to see what type of
&+carea you are in. Some of the ingredients you will come up with are
&+ggreen herb&+c, &+Wfaerie dust&+c, &+Wgarlic&+c, &+ymandrake root&+c and &+Lnightshade&+c.&n

  &+cThe &+CAlc&+chem&+Cist&+c stands up and points to the garden south, "go south and&n
&+cpractice your foraging. Come back when you are done and we will work&n
&+con mixing."&n
~
M
ttttttt~
  &+cTo mix potions first you must have some &Nempty potion bottles&+c. You can&n
&+cpurchase these or have a mage minor create some for you. Now with the&n
&+cpotion bottles in your inventory you need to have the ingredients&n
&+cneeded for the potion you would like to create.&n

  &+cLets take the first potion in your recipe book you can &+Wmix&+c, the potion&n
&+cof &+Ymagic missiles&+c. Have &+Wgarlic&+c and some &+Wfaerie dust&+c in your inventory&n
&+cwith the bottles and use the &+Wmix&+c command. It will make a batch of potions
&+cfor you. The amount of potions you make is based on your experience and
&+cyour mixing skill.&n
~
M
ssssss~
  &+cThe &+CAlc&+chem&+Cist&+c looks a bit tired but continues, "Ok, now lets work&n
&+con potion throwing! With the potion in your inventory you will need to&n
&+c(throwpotion) (potion type) (target). A bit of caution... you will&n
&+csometimes miss your target and hit another player or mob in the room.&n

  &+cThe &+CAlc&+chem&+Cist&+c walks over to his workbench. "Crafting is one of the

  &+cTo craft select the materials you want to use place them into your

  &+c+The material would be something like a piece of &+glimestone&n.

hi hello howdy greetings begin ready~
$n trots excitedly, &+c"Welcome young one. I will tell you
&+cabout us. &+gDruids&+c are powerful priestly types that concentrate their discipline
&+ctoward the betterment of nature and world preservation.  They generally worship
&+cdeities of the &+Gfor&+ges&+Gt&+c and of nature and will dispatch anyone attempting to
&+cdesecrate or destroy a forest.  Although their &+Wspells&+c are primarily defensive
&+cin nature, they do command some very potent offensive magic once they attain
&+cthe higher &+Wcircles&n &+cof power.

&+c"I would be glad to give you more information, just tell me what you'd like to
&+cknow.

  &+C-Spells and Commune
  &+C-Innates
  &+C-Specializations
  &+C-Casting
  &+C-Circles

$n adds &+c"Before you get ready to leave this area
&+cof &+rDu&+Rr&+ris&+c, come back and ask me about a &+Wquest&+c to see if you are prepared."

spell spells commune communing~
$n skips proudly in your direction and begins to speak.

&+c"&+gDruids &+chave shunned the pantheon of gods and allied themselves with the
&+cnatural world instead.  &+gDruids &+Wcommune&N &+cwith their surroundings, taking in the
&+cnatural power inherent in every living thing.  Over the course of time, that
&+cpower will manifest itself as &+Wspells&+c the druid can command as their own.
&+cThis manifestation will not occur if the druid is fighting, unconscious or
&+cotherwise not able to fully focus upon the natural surroundings.  The amount
&+cof time it takes for power to flow back to the druid depends on the area where
&+cthe druid is. &+WResting&+c does accentuate this process in nearly all terrians. In
&+Gfor&+ges&+Gt&+gs&+c and places of healthy nature, communing will not take nearly as long as
&+ca place like a &+Lswamp&+c or &+wcrypt&+c.

&+c"Use the &+Wcommune&n &+ccommand to begin your memorization of your spells.  Use the
&+Wspells&+c command to see which are available to you, they will appear as so:

&+B1st CIRCLE:
animal friendship
barkskin
fortitude
pulchritude

&+B2nd CIRCLE
&+Laid
&+Ldisease
&+Lsticks to snakes

&+c"In this example the ones that are greyed out are not yet available."
~
M
casting cast memorization memorize mem~
$n waves a hand through the air before beginning.
&+c"To cast a spell is a simple thing really.  As long as you have communed with
&+cnature first, you may cast any spell from circles that have not yet been
&+cdepleted.  Use the &+Wcast&N &+ccommand followed by the spell name enclosed by
&+Wapostrophes&+c, and then the target name, if necessary.  Try casting &+Wfortitude
&+con yourself now, &+Wcast 'fortitude' me&+c!"
~
M

$n nods and tells you, &+c"Spells are granted in &+Wcircles
&+cof specific power.  As you grow in power, you will be obtain new circles of
&+cspells. Within each circle, you will be granted a certain number of spell slots
&+cthat determine the number of spells you can cast before you need to &+Wcommune&+c.
&+cThe &+Wspells &+ccommand will show you which spells are available to you, and which
&+care not yet available.  The unavailable spells will be &+Lgreyed&+c out in your spell
&+clist. Use the &+Wcommune&+c command to see the number of available slots per circle"
~
M
innate innates~
$n giggles, &+c"Just use the &+Winnate&+c command and it will
&+ctell you what abilities the &+YG&+yo&+wd&+Ls&+c have blessed your race or chosen path with."

&+c"What else would you like to know?"
~
M
spec specs specialization specializations~
$n announces, &+c"Specializations allow you to
&+cfurther enhance certain abilities you have learned and use them to a greater
&+ceffect.  They also focus your way of life and define who you are. With so many
&+ccivilizations having different needs and races within each of them, they guide
&+cyour destiny and choices of how you can &+Wspecialize&+c. That is, if you choose to."

   &+W-&+gFo&+Gre&+gst Druid
   &+W-&+cStorm &+CDruid&+c

"The &+gFo&+Gre&+gst Druid&n specialization focuses on utilizing the forces of nature
for both offensive and defensive purposes."

"The &+cStorm &+CDruid&n specialization focuses on offensive magic, with spells that
mainly do damage in battle."

$n continues &+c"To determine which specialization
&+cis available to you use the &+Wspec&+c command. Be absolute in your decission and
&+cuse any resource to your advantage, such as the &+Whelp&+c files."
~
M
quest quests~
$n looks sternly at you and sizes you up.  He begins
to smile and he says, &+c"Well if you would like to go on a quest for me, I could
&+cuse a few items to help with my commune.  Go into the woods and gather some
&+citems from nature.  If those items aid me, I will reward you with an earthy
&+citem.  Though I do warn you, it will take several items.  If you can't figure
&+cout what &+Gitems&+c I want, just ask me.  Now be on your way!"
~
M
item items~
$n thinks for a moment and replies, &+c"How about
&+yan acorn&+c, &Na &+Lbroken&N &+gtree branch&+c, and &Na &+rred &+Lfeather&+c.  Don't forget you may need
&+cto do some &+Wsearching&+c to find the right items."

$n nods at your question and dives into a long speech.
&+W"Your spells can be d&+Res&+Wtructive to the soulless, informative to the senses,
&+Wcurative to friends, &+Ror&+W debilitating to foe.  Because you are a follower of a

$n begins speaking in a high pitched &+RGnomish&N voice.
&+W"To cast a spell, y&+Rou &+Wmust first have studied it and committed it to memory.
&+WTo do this, you mus&+Rt b&+Wegin by &+Cresting&+W and then you &+Cpray&+W for each spell you

&+W"A &NHealer &+Wwields the divine powers of restoration like no other.  True

  "&+BWelcome and salutations.  It will be my honor to pass my

$n solemnly nods before beginning, &+B"Skills
&+Bare methods of survival or battle tactics and techniques that are learned by
&+Bclasses through use over time.  Your proficiency at a skill will increase over
&+Btime if you apply the skill as you adventure. Use the &+Wskills&+B command to see all
&+Byou have.  As a warrior two of your most important skills to practice will be
&+Wbash&+B and &+Wrescue&+B.

&+B"To &+Wbash &+Bsomeone is to attempt to knock that person to the ground with a fierce
&+Bcharge.  If you succeed, you will inflict minor damage and cause the victim to
&+Bfall down.  Both you and the victim will be unable to respond for a short
&+Bduration.  If you fail to bash successfully, you will lose your balance and
&+Bfall.  It is more difficult to bash someone who is not standing, but it is
&+Bpossible.  Anyone who is not standing risks taking greater damage from
&+Bphysical attacks directed at them.  It is much easier to bash someone if you
&+Bare using a shield, and preferably a heavy shield.

&+B"When you aren't knocking things to the ground, you may wish to save a comrade
&+Bfrom a fate worse than your own.  To step into harm's way and remove another
&+Bfrom combat, you may &+Wrescue &+Bthem.  This skill is very important since
&+Bmany of your friend's may not be as specialized at fighting as you are, and
&+Bmay not be able to defend themselves as well.

&+cmade to your specifications.  Finding a dock where this is possible shouldn't
&+cbe too difficult! If you do purchase a ship of your own here are some of the
&+cbasic commands you will need to maneuver your vessel."

   -Undock and Maneuver
   -Speed and Heading
   -Tactical Map and Contact List

"&+cAsk me about these if you wish or consult &+Whelp ship&N &+cfor more information.&N"
~

undock maneuver maneuvering~
$n explains, "&+cYea you can't go anywhere without knowing
&+cthese. All of the commands of your ship must be done on the bridge. The &+bBridge
&+cwill be located in different locations, of course, depending on which ship your
&+con.  To get your ship ready to sail you will need to &+Worder undock&+c from the
&+cbridge. It will take some time to be prepared to sail as the crew will work
&+cfrantically to get underway.&N"

"&+cOnce your ship is undocked and the &+Gfirst mate&+c gives you the &N'&+GOK&N' &+cyou will need
&+cto maneuver slowly out of the shipyard. Since all shipyards are designed a tad
&+cbit differently you will have to &+Wlook out&+c and see which direction you can move.
&+cNow after that, its time to maneuver. Send out your orders from the bridge with
&+can &+Worder maneuver <dir>&+c. Isn't that great, your moving towards the open sea!&N"
~
M
speed heading~
$n continues, "&+cNow once you have maneuvered your way onto
&+cthe open sea you will need to set a course. While standing at the bridge
&+Worder heading <dir>&+c. This direction can be numerical like that of the degrees
&+cof a circle or they can be directions you would find on a compass.&N"

 "&+cTo set your speed is much the same as your heading. &+WOrder speed max&+c will tell
&+cyour crew that your desire is to open your sails completely and move at maximum
&+cknots.  The amount of knots you travel is also dependant on the size of your
&+cship.  If you &+Wlook ship&+c from the bridge you can see information on your vessels
&+ccapabilities including its maximum and current speed. Now your underway! I am
&+cgoing to give you a bit of advice even though you didn't ask, &+Wtoggle ship&+c.&N"

contact map list tactical~
$n reaches for one of $s rolled maps and spreads it out.

&+yGrinda&N concludes, "&+cWell your just becoming quite the inquisitive sailor arn't
&+cya. Here is what you will see from your bridge when you &+Wlook tactical&+c. This
&+cmap is a hex version on the large scale to allow you to see a far. A sailor
&+cwith more experience could also use this command to look to other sections of
&+cthe seas by entering tactical numbers after the &+Wlook tactical&+c command.&N"

&+yGrinda&N cringes for just a moment as she speaks, "&+cDo not take your eye off this
&+cwhen your sailing for very long. The way my story goes is this. I was running
&+csome cargo between &+WSto&+Lrm &+bPort&+c and the &+GE&+glven&N Continent&+c and I was nearly sunk as
&+ca enemy vessel approached. If you &+Wlook contact&+c it will give you information on
&+cif there are any other ships in the vicinity. If there are other ships you can
&+clook at their call letters. These letters will be next to the ships name on the
&+clist. Be warned tho, you have to get somewhat close to identify other ships.&N"

hi hello advice help information info~
$n says, "&+cBetter be careful round here young adventurer,
&+csome critters you may come across will be trickier to handle than others.&N"

"&+cYou see them &+ydogs&+c there to the east, they're mean, bound to instantly attack
&+canyone that walks into their room.  Critters that do that are called &+Waggro&+c,
&+cwhich is short for aggressive.&N"

"&+cThose evil &+mdrow&+c to the south, well they protect their own, and if you attack
&+cone of them, they'll all assist and you'll have more on you than you might be
&+cable to handle!  So watch for that too.&n"

"&+cOne strategy to deal with many aggro or assisting mobs in one room is to &+Wlure&N
&+cone out.  Luring means to hit one of them critters in there and then run away
&+cto make it follow you.  You can use the commands &+Wflee&n &+cor &+Wretreat&+c to do
&+cthat, but if there are multiple exits from the room you might not want to
&+cflee deeper into an area with the nasty beasties!  Oh!!! One other thing, this
&+cshould work for most mobs, but it of course will not work for sentinel critters
&+cthat don't like to leave the room they're in.&N"

"&+cYou can also lure things by casting a &+Wrange&N &+cspell or &+Wthrow&+c a dagger into the
&+croom, &+Chowever&+c you will make everything in that room angry and &+cchase you.&N"

"&+cOne last thing friend!  The more varied critters you kill the better

 &+RA figure dressed in &+Lblack&n &+Rnods at you as he walks over. "Welcome to&n
 &+Rour deadly group. Lemme give you a rundown of what we're about. Assassins&n
 &+Rare practitioners of death and stealth, always lurking down dark alleys&n
 &+Rand just around the corner, ready to commit a convenient act of&n
 &+Rmurder if it suits them. Assassins are adept at the art of concealment and&n
 &+Rdeception, but they are not as skilled at the art of stealth as other&n
 &+Rrelated classes might be. Assassins are by far the most deadly creatures&n
 &+Raround if they catch you by surprise and happen to be carrying their&n
 &+Rfavorite daggers with them."&n

 &+R"If you are still interested, I can give you some more information.&n

 &+C-skills&n

~
M
skill skills~
&+R"Skills, well yes those are important,"&n the rogue grins.&n
&+R"Skills are methods of survival or battle tactics and techniques that are&n
&+Rlearned by classes through use over time.&n

&+RYour proficiency at a skill will increase over time if you apply the skill&n
&+Ras you adventure. Some of the most important skills you will use are&n
&+Rbackstab, sneak, hide, track and disguise.&n

&+RA backstab is an attempt to sneak up on the victim and place a weapon in&n
&+Rthe victim's back at exactly the point where it will do the most damage.&n
&+RThe amount of damage incurred is dependent on the proficiency of the&n
&+Rbackstabber and the dice on the weapon used. You may only backstab with&n
&+Rpiercing weapons.&n

&+RSneak allows you to move silently from one place to another. A person who&n
&+Rsneaks successfully will be able to travel (for a period of time) without&n
&+Ranyone taking notice of his or her arrival or departure. As with most&n
&+Rlearned skills, there is always a chance that you will not sneak&n
&+Rsuccessfully and, with this particular command, you will be unable to tell&n
&+Rif it has worked or not. You can quit sneaking with "sneak off."&n

&+R"Hide" allows you to cleverly conceal yourself from the occupants of a room,&n
&+Rregardless of whether they are other players or creatures.&n

&+RThis allows you to track your quarry. How successfully you track down a&n
&+Rpotential victim depends on your skill level and how far away your target&n
&+Ris. You can not track down specific racewar enemies, even if you happen to&n
&+Rknow the name of a particularly notorious foe. When you have given up the&n
&+Rtrail, you must type 'track off' in order stop tailing the quarry.&n

&+RWith a proper assortment of items, a player may attempt to change their&n
&+Rappearance. With an amount of skill as well, they may actually succeed.&n
&+RThe more skill you have the more you will be able to disguise as someone&n
&+Rinstead of just race. Check local justice to see if disguise is allowed.&n
~

&+RThe dark rogue continues, "Typing "innate", gives you a list of your race's or classes' &n

&+CWhen you have finished memorizing your spells and your studies are complete you
&+Cnow are ready to cast one of them at your leisure. To cast a spell you must be

$n regards you a moment before smiling in greeting.

  &+C"Hello there!  Are you here to learn about &+Lbeing an Ethermancer? It is so
&+Cgood to have another student to teach!  Firs&+Lt off, let me tell you about us.
&+CEthermancers wield the power of the element&+Ls, drawn from the ether that
&+Cseparates two planes of existance. Ha, yea&+Lh I can see it on your face. It can
&+Cbe a difficult class to grasp at first bu&+Lt make no mistake we can wield powers
&+Cfound only in storms. Let me try and bre&+Lak it down for you, ask me about:

   &+W-&+BInnates
   &+W-&+BSpells: Casting and Tupor

&+CThe &+LEthermancer&+C smiles and nods at you, and begi&+Lns a lesson on elements.
&+C"Your spells can be destructive, informative, c&+Lurative, or debilitating
&+Cdepending on how you use them.  Let's go over &+Lhow to gather our power before
&+Cwe begin casting."

&+C"The elements of the planes are tapped by e&+Lthermancers through their connection
&+Cwith the &+gEthereal&+C Plane. &+WTupor&+C is our form&+L of meditation that provides us the
&+Clink and concentration necessary to harne&+Lss this power. This ability is unique
&+Cwhen compared to regular magic users. Ma&+Lgic users must memorize specific spells
&+Cthat they wish to cast, while ethermanc&+Lers and the use of &+Wtupor&+L we can channel
&+Cthe energy into any form we wish. To b&+Legin your tupor you use must &+Wrest&+L first
&+Cthen use the &+Wtupor&+C command. If your w&+Lish is to determine how many more spells
&+Cyou can cast, use the &+Wtupor&+C command &+Las well."

$n &+Ccough&+Ls and continues, "Now that you are aware how
&+Cethermancers gather their power, &+Llets discuss how to &+Wcast&+L our magic. The world
&+Cof &+rDu&+Rr&+ris&+C uses &+Wapostrophes&+C as the&+L magical symbols needed to cast. So any spell
&+Cthat is casted is enclosed with&+L these. Use the &+Wcast&+L command and follow it by
&+Cthe name of your spell enclose&+Ld with the symbols then followed by your target.
&+CLets try it now. Follow my ex&+Lample: &+Wcast 'vapor armor' me&+L.

&+Cgrow as will thee amount of energy you&+L can contain at one time. These will be

&+La spell now. Take your spellbook and quill and hold both of them in your hands.

&+L"After you hold your &+yspellbook&+L and &+wquill&+L you will need to &+mrest&+L comfortably.
&+LNow practice the spells which you wish to have access to into your book by
&+Lusing the &+mpractice&+L command followed by the spell name. The &+mscribe&+L skill works
&+Lmuch the same as practice but is done by copying another spellbook. It can be
&+Lyours or another one you've found or borrowed from another mage.  Spells that
&+Lare available for you to copy are listed under the &+mspells&+L command or the
&+mpractice&+L command when a teacher is present."

casting cast memorization memorize mem~
$n &+Lsays,  "To cast spells, you'll have studied and
&+Lcommitted it to memory beforehand. To commit spells to memory you must first be
&+mresting&+L and have your spellbook be accessible either in your  inventory, hands,
&+Lor attached to your belt. After that, simply &+mmemorize&+L the spells that you wish.
&+LEach spell you memorize will be added to your repertoire of spells.  All spells
&+Lare assigned a &+mcircle&+L level and the higher the level the longer it will take to
&+Lcommit to memory from your  repertoire.  Each time you cast  a  spell the spell
&+Lwill return to your repertoire and will need to be memorized again. If you wish
&+Lto swap out a spell from your repertoire  you will need to  first  &+mforget&+L that
&+Lspell to replace it.

&+L"Once you have a spell or a list of spells in your repertoire you may want to
&+Lgo into a meditation. &+mMeditation&+L is a skill of users of magic and whose benefit
&+Lhelps reduce the amount of time you will need to memorize spells by up to half.
&+LMeditation is a highly mind consuming task however and can easily be broken if
&+Lyou lose concentration."

&+LWhen you have finished memorizing your spells and your studies are complete you
&+Lnow are ready to &+mcast&+L one of them at your leisure. To cast a spell you must be
&+Lstanding and you will need to include the spell name enclosed in &+mapostrophes
&+Llike this: &+mcast 'minor creation' bandage.&+L  If you don't recall which spells you
&+Lhave memorized you can use the &+mmemorize&+L command, after all you are a novice.

circles spellcircle~
$n &+Lnods and rasps, "Spells are granted in &+mcircles
&+Lof specific power. As you grow in power, you will be granted new circles of
&+Lspells to memorize and cast.  Within each circle, you will be granted a certain
&+Lnumber of spells you may memorize at one time.  To switch from one spell
&+Lmemorize to another, you use the &+mforget&+L command.  To forget everything you have
&+Lmemorized you may &+mforget all&+L.  Once you have forgotten a spell, you may
&+Lmemorize another from the same circle in its place."

&+L"&+mVampires&+L are powerful warriors.  They &+mtank&+L well, do nice damage, and vampiric

dracolichs dracolich draco dracoliches~
&+L"&+mDracoliches&+L are warriors-type dragons with a few bonuses.  They have higher

&+LThe &+mNecromancer&+L walks over to the undead, "To command them to do your

spec specs specialization~
&+LThe &+mNecromancer&+L rubs his hands together and reaches into his bookcase pulling
&+Lout a thick tomb. He looks around and makes sure nobody is looking and whispers
&+Lto you, "Did you know there is a way to obtain even more spell knowledge and
&+Lbecome more powerful?"

&+LHe opens the tomb and points to the pages...

&+L"A &+mNecromancer&+L can choose one of three different paths to specialize in.  Each
&+Lpath has its own focus upon a specific aspect of power.  The three choices are:

   &+W-&+mDia&+rbolis
   &+W-&+mNe&+Lcro&+mlyte
   &+W-&+LReap&+wer

&+LThe &+mDia&+rbolis&+L is a master of assembling flesh and bone to form constructs.
&+LTheir study of blood magic gives them the knowledge to exhume dead from the
&+Lground.

&+LThe &+mNe&+Lcro&+mlyte&+L possesses heightened senses capable of detecting the dead.
&+LHe is a high study of control and may manage a high number of undead that are
&+Lforced into irreversible submission."

&+LAnd finally the &+LReap&+wer&+L, these are experts at wielding staves and daggers.
&+LThere is no hesitation weighing into combat for these mages. They have mastered
&+Lcontrol over the necromancer's &+mvampiric trance&+L and can &+mremort&+L at will."

&+mTaiz&+L closes his dark book of spells and rubs his chin as he gazes at you and
&+Lponders your request. Taking your hand in his clammy one, he walks you over to
&+Lthe side of the room away from anyone else.

&+L"Through &+mdeath&+L we gain powers, if you would like to achieve these powers I can
&+Lgive you a task that will indeed make you more powerful.  First you must take
&+La &+Wlife&+L, and for many they are not ready.  Find a holyman, the more innocent the
&+Lbetter.  Bring his bones to me, with that you will prove your readiness to
&+Lembrace the dead and their powers."&n
