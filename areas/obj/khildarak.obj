statue khildarak strongstone~
This statue is carved from pure &+Wgranite&N by the members of clan Shatter Stone.
The statue shows &+WKhildarak Strongstone&N with his hammer raised high over his
head in mid-swing. His face bears an expression of &+rrage&N as he charges in a
ferocious attack. This pose was chosen as it was the last view that many of
his foes had of this world. The armor and war hammer of &+WKhildarak Strongstone&N
have been rumored to be obtainable. A large &+ybronze plaque&N has been mounted
on the base of the statue.
