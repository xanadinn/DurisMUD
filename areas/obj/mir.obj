suit white dragon scale mail~
&+W   This suit is made from white dragon scales, held together by delicate but
&+Wvery strong mithril chainlinks. Thanks to this construction, the armor has
&+Wlittle affect on wearer's ability to move freely, while the magic of dragons
&+Wis still working. However, the armor's thickness can be annoying in the long
&+Wrun, thus preventing from long travels without rest.
