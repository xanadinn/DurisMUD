These pair of mithril sleeves are nice. Mithril is one of the strongest
metals known to exist, if it weren't for adamantium, it would undoubtably be the
strongest. There are patches of the chainlinked mail where mithril plates
exist, some of these places are around the wrists and around the elbows and
around the shoulders. Etched into these mithril plates are runes. These
runes are not the native magical language of this land, so they must possess some
sort of magic unseen by most, if not all, magi.
