journal~
&+yThis leather-bound journal appears to be that of Theodeus Nak'ral.
&+yThough mostly filled with complex chemical formulas and vast mathematical
&+yproofs, there are a few interesting entries:

        Although the gods have granted us life, and it has by large
        been good, surely anyone must realize that even life can be
        improved upon.  Just as the catapult has been made more deadly
        over time, so can life.  Through benefit of magic and science,
        the ultimate lifeform can be created.  If cautious enough, it
        can even be kept under our power to do our bidding, allowing
        us to be free from our menial tasks.  Even wars could be fought
        by creatures of our own creation!  Think of it!  No more
        senseless dying, no more mothers crying as their sons die in
        yet another endless slaughter.


&+yAnother interesting entry can be seen on page 17.

E
page17 17~
&+yPage 17

        I have come to realize that no matter how much you try to help
        others, they will always come to take it the wrong way.  The
        means, though not readily accepted by all greatly justify the
        ends, especially when speaking of the benefit of mankind.  No
        matter how much I have tried, no one can understand..  I am
        reaching the point where I may give up my research.  It is only
        being taken the wrong way.


&+ySeveral pages later:

        I have made an incredible breakthrough today - by harnessing the
        powers of evil, amazing things can be accomplished.  It is not the
        method that I would have preferred, but all else has failed and
        this appears to be the only way.  When my work is revered across
        the land, none will care.


&+yIt appears as though the last entry is on page 24.
~
E
page24 24~
&+yPage 24

        I am finding it difficult to find the line between good and evil..
        Today I felt the strange compulsion to go up to the graveyard and
        dig up a body, and only days later am I beginning to think it may
        have been wrong.  Perhaps I am getting too involved in my work..
        I have not been to town in weeks...  It seems I can no longer trust
        anyone, even those I most trusted have turned against me..

        I have come to realize my only choice is to continue until my work
        is finished, for better or worse.  It is too late to turn back now.
        The control of life MUST be revealed, or they will never witness the
        almighty power that can be had.  Only then can people realize how
        WRONG they truly were.
