The umber hulk fought a great battle, with something, but it suffered a number
of strange puncture wounds and now lies impaled on a number of broken crystals.
Umber hulks are known to feed on gems and crystals, and also known to be quite
ferocious warriors, but something quite a bit more powerful ran into this beast
and put it down.  Broken crystals now protrude straight through its body from
the floor, and a long shard has been planted through its mouth and head into
the ground as some sort of symbol for any others that might come by.

crystal burning hot red-hot~
The crystal glows with a bizarre red color, a color that indicates its
incredible heat.  It would be easy to believe that this crystal is what has
created such unbearable heat throughout the entire network of caverns.  A
pool of shallow water surrounds the crystal, but doesn't seem to have any
cooling effect.  The water is simply turned into searing steam, anyone daring
to touch the stone will undoubtedly be badly burned.

ring silver band~
This simple silver band has been endowed with a faint magic, perhaps one
only meant to keep it from tarnishing.  Whatever the case may be, its
simplicity alone makes it oddly attractive.

shards remains crystal~
The shattered remains of a blue crystal golem lie here.  Whether a failed
experiment or outright destruction of a golem, its remains have clearly been
left here for quite some time.

table stone~
Heavy stone has been used to create a sturdy table capable of withstanding
years of abuse.  Layers of dust and moisture from the air have helped create
a thin, sticky, layer of mud over the top of the table.  Nobody has bothered
to enter this room for many years.

book~
The book was clearly not very important to its previous owner.  It was
carelessly left out in wet conditions and it has begun to rot and decay.
Water has soaked through it to the point that the ink has run and nothing
of any value can be garnered by its study.

carpet~
Intricate drow designs cover the length of this massive carpet, a carpet that
must once have been worth a huge amount of money.  Careless use, or misuse,
has left it a worthless, rotting wreck.  Whatever nobleman or thief once
owned it must have been wealthy enough to ignore its painful demise.

throne crystal~
The large throne has been made entirely of different shades of blue crystal.
It appears to sit in mid-air until one realizes that it is really standing on
a transparent crystal dais.  It is almost as if the throne, and dais, were
simply grown out of the floor and somehow colorized by its maker.

water crystal shard~
This bizzare crystal appears to be as much water as it is stone.  It is
sharp and jagged, and seems to have a life and intelligence of its own.
Then again, it may just be its watery appearance that makes it seem so
deadly and life-like.
