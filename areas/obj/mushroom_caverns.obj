ladder~
&+c   This iron ladder is covered with rust due to the constant
&+cdripping of water coming from the ceiling and cavern walls.
&+cThe design seems very old and it's a wonder that it is still
&+cin good enough condition to use.

Entrance into this pool of water appears possible, however, the current
is strong enough that returning to this area will be impossible.

chain~
    The chain is quite thick, each link two feet long and one foot wide.
Near one end the chain is twisted and warped after being heated which
caused it to snap and fall to where it now lies. The entire surface is
heavily stained by soot and rust.
