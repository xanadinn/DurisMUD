globe smoke~
Although the swirling smoke glows with a powerful magic, it is impossible
to tell what sort of magic it is.  The lack of identification may make it
dangerous to possess, but its magical power makes it an attractive item.

The job of detaching the head from the body was rather neatly done, though
it is bloody it is easy to recognise the face and the tattoos that are on
it.

Small spheres of obsidian have been linked together on an obsidian chain.

A single piece of obsidian has been carved into a beautiful, and
protective bracer.  The bracer itself glows with a bright magical aura,
magic that allows it to expand and contract so that a wearer can remove it
or put it on with ease.

sword mithril massive large~
The symbol of the Darvanu mercenary house has been placed on the blade
close to the hilt.  The sword hums with magical power, seeming to quiver
with a lust for blood all of its own.  Few creatures in the world are
strong enough to hold the massive blade in one hand, even using two hands
the blade is heavy.  The magic that permeates the blade seems to flow into
anyone daring to wield it, making it an awesome weapon indeed.

cloak silk~
The cloak is virtually weightless, floating in the air all on its own.
Though the silk is thin and light, it has been impregnated with heavy
magics that make it as tough and durable as the hardest metals, while
still being soft and comfortable to wear.

to surround the amulet, and anyone wearing it, providing powerful magical

This intricate little earring has been shaped like a tiny horn.  The
details are so exquisite that one would almost think the horn could work.
The earring glows with powerful magic, but few would be seen wearing such
a gaudy piece.

ring black strange~
Rather than being black, it would be better to say that the ring is
completely devoid of light or color.  It seems to leech the color and
light from everything that surrounds it.
