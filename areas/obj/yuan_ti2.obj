The nice thing about it is that it can be as easily used to subdue as to kill,
and one never has to worry about sharpening it.

The naked corpse is that of an elf.  Long cuts along the torso of the corpse
show that the elf was tortured for a long time.  A message of some sort has
been painted on the undamaged chest, acting as a sign for all who pass by.
Every other part of the corpse has been mutilated in some way.

The hollow fangs of hundreds of poisonous snakes have been strung together to
create this intricate cloak.  Though it wouldn't appear comfortble at first,
the cloak really doesn't possess the sharp edges that one would expect from
all the fangs used in its construction.  The thin cords used to hold the cloak
together appear to be made from some sort of metallic thread that has been
carefully spun together.

protect it from the environment and this lyre, though beautiful, needs to be
polished and tuned daily to keep it in good shape.  Any bard that knows the
worth of such a fine piece would never hesitate to purchase it.

blade sword serpent~
This incredible silver blade is difficult to explain.  It is extremely
well-made, clearly deeply magical, and yet bears the symbols and signs of the
yuan-ti god Skrentherlog.  It is hard to believe that the yuan-ti have the
skill to make such a blade themselves, the sharp edge and serpentine blade
would require a master blacksmith.  At the same time, it is difficult to
think of anyone with such skills that would trade with them.  A small symbol
at the base of the blade might explain who made it, but the symbol itself
is difficult to interpret.
~
E
symbol~
Close inspection of the tiny symbol at the base of the blade reveals it to be
a small G inside a circle.  The upper flange of the G has been formed into a
sword that appears to be striking down some sort of tentacled creature.

The arms and legs of this burning victim were spread out and tied to stakes
that were suck into the floor.  The remains of the body have stayed spread
eagled despite the fact that the ropes that once held it have burned away.
Close inspection of the corpse suggests that its stomach was covered with
something highly flammable that was used to start the fire that consumed both
it and the hut around it.

This half-sphere of gold has been carefully etched along its curved side to

allow people to wear it.  There is nothing particularily frightening about
the eye, nor really anything particularily special.  The materials and
careful craftsmanship suggest that it is ceremonial in nature and could be
quite valuable to the right people.
