|   Ah Thalos, Thalos!  Once so beautiful, even   |
|   envied by the gods!  But now it is no more,   |
|   cast down for its pride.                      |
|                                                 |
|   We fled the city, but I can feel *them*       |
|   following after us, tracking us like a wolf.  |
|   But no wolf was ever this deadly.             |
|                                                 |
|   Behind us is horror, and the city before us   |
|   has an evil reputation.  It is said that      |
|   Nizari's Sultan has made pacts with Evil --   |
|   But more on that later.  I an hear them       |
|   coming.  No!  They are here!  They are he     |
|                                                 |

The key is fashioned of the finest steel, with a few small gems set in the

well nigh impossible to pick.

The key looks as if it had been struck from a sliver of flint; there are
no edges that appear to have been filed or chipped.  It seems like the
key had grown naturally in the earth...

The key isn't simply gold-plated copper; it is 14 carat gold all the way
through.  It has a single large ruby set in the pommel that seems, in
certain light, to pulse slightly.

This key is a work of art in and of itself; the carefully shaped silver is
the product of hours of work by a master silversmith.

This scepter is flashy, but deadly.  The rod has an almost palpable magical

|   The First Book of Moses Called GENESIS                                 |
|                                                                          |
|   In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.  The earth was |
|   without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep.  And |
|   the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.  Then God  |
|   said, "Let there be light,"; and there was light.  And God saw the     |
|   light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.  |
|   God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night.  So the    |
|   evening and the morning were the first day.  Then God said, "Let there |
|   be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the       |
|   waters from the waters."   Thus God made the firmament, and divided    |
|   the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were   |
|   above the firmament; and it was so.  And God called the firmament      |
|   Heaven.  So the evening and the morning were the second day.  Then     |
|   God said, "Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together in    |
|   one place, and let the dry land appear."; and it was so.  And God      |
|   called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters    |
|   He called Seas.  And God saw that it was good...                       |
|                                                                          |

|   The house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the village.    |
|   It stood on its own and looked out over a broad spread of West       |
|   Country farmland.  Not  a remarkable house by any means -- it was    |
|   about thirty years old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and had  |
|   four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which more    |
|   or less exactly failed to please the eye.                            |
|      The only person for whom the house was in any way special was     |
|   Arthur Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the one he  |
|   lived in.  He had lived in it for about three years, ever since he   |
|   had moved out of Midgaard because it made him nervous and irritable. |
|   He was about thirty as well, tall, dark-haired and never quite at    |
|   ease with himself.  The thing that used to worry him most was the    |
|   fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so       |
|   worried about...                                                     |
|                                                                        |

|   It is a pain in the ass waiting around for someone to try to kill     |
|   you.  But it was April 30, and of course it would happen as it always |
|   did.  It had taken me a while to catch on, but now I at least knew    |
|   when it was coming.  In the past, I'd been too busy to do anything    |
|   about it.  But my job was finished now.  I'd only stayed around for   |
|   this.  I felt that I really ought to clear the matter up before I     |
|   departed.  I got out of bed, visited the bathroom, showered, brushed  |
|   my teeth, et cetera.  I'd grown a beard again, so I didn't have to    |
|   shave.  I was not jangling with strange apprehensions, as I had been  |
|   on that April 30 three years ago when I'd awakened with a headache    |
|   and a premonition, thrown open the windows, and gone to the kitchen   |
|   to discover all of the gas burners turned on and flameless.  No.  It  |
|   wasn't even like the April 30 two years ago in the other apartment    |
|   when I awoke before dawn to a faint smell of smoke to learn that the  |
|   place was on fire.  Still, I stayed out of direct line of the light   |
|   fixtures in case the bulbs were filled with something flammable,      |
|   and I flipped all of the switches rather than pushing them.  Nothing  |
|   untoward followed these actions....                                   |
|                                                                         |

|   This work deals with four magical weapons of this world.  There are    |
|   many others, but they are for other scholars with more knowledge (and  |
|   patience) than I to cope with.  All of them are powerful, imbued with  |
|   strange and sometimes hideous abilities.  And all four are far beyond  |
|   the reach of an ordinary mortal ...                                    |
|                                                                          |
|   ...Doombringer the Sword of Chaos is one of the most dangerous of      |
|   the four, but is by far the most mundane.  It will, on  occasion,      |
|   blur and vibrate wildly in the hands of its owner, striking the foe    |
|   not once or twice, but many, many times.  Some legends indicate that   |
|   in the hands of the truly lucky, it has struck fifteen blows to the    |
|   enemy's *ONE*.  Truly a formidable ally and frightening foe ...        |

|   ...there have been rumors in the underworld that one of Death's Angels |
|   has 'borrowed' Death's scythe ... and is wandering somewhere upon our  |
|   plane of existence.  With the scythe.  It is not known just what the   |
|   Scythe does, as Death has never had to use it on anyone.  The ones     |
|   he comes for are already dead ...                                      |
|                                                                          |
|   ...the sword of fire and flame is the third of the quartet.            |
|   Ofttimes this diabolical weapon will become engulfed in magical flames |
|   that do not harm the wielder, but shoot out to engulf a victim!  This  |
|   weapon does unkind amounts of damage when the sword strikes alone, but |
|   in combination with the fireball, most normal monsters stand not a     |
|   chance.  A handy weapon, and a must for discriminating barbecue-ers... |

|   ...perhaps the most evil of the enchanted weapons is Avernus the Life  |
|   stealer.  As the name indicates, it will, when the mood strikes it,    |
|   drain the very life force from the enemy of the wielder, dipping its   |
|   blade deep into the body and draining life.  Then, when it has drunk   |
|   deeply (I know not how damaging it is to the creature it happens to;   |
|   all that I have seen affected have died), it feeds the life energy     |
|   into the hands that hold it -- thus replenishing and healing the       |
|   sword's master...                                                      |
|                                                                          |
|   The exact locations of these enchanted weapons are not known, and it   |
|   is, I believe, all for the better.  All were, in ages past, stolen     |
|   from their human masters by the most powerful of dragons, or demons,   |
|   or monsters (the exception being the Scythe).  So these weapons are,   |
|   for better or for worse, beyond the reach of men ...                   |
|                                                                          |
|   Or so I fervently pray.                                                |
|                                                                          |

The handle is finely wrought steel, inlaid with gold; a single red ruby is
set in the pommel.  The blade is seven inches of clear glass that
seems strong enough to penetrate metal.

The liquid in the vial swirls as if it was sandy, but a small
sample of it reveals it to be textureless and as smooth as,
say, smooth as stone.
