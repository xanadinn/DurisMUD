granite head ancient~
&+L   A fourteen foot tall &+wgranite&+L head has been erected here.  Its stone visage
&+Lreminds you of the much smaller &+Gpygmies&+L that inhabit this area.  It has full
&+Llips and slightly slanted bulbous eyes.  The outlines of tribal &+ctattoos&+L have
&+Lbeen carved upon its face, their spiral patterns lending to the primitive
&+Lappearance of this ancient form.  The head appears as if it were asleep.&n

granite head~
&+L   A monstrous &+wgranite&+L head pokes through the vine covered &+Gjungle&+L floor,
&+Lits mouth wide in anger or fear, bearing many teeth and a deep throat.  &+gVines
&+Lhave securely lashed the huge cranium to the &+ysoil&+L of the forest floor, making
&+Lthe head appear to writhe in an attempt to escape.  Etched upon its face are
&+Lthe outlines of tribal war &+ctattoos&+L, and you notice its eyes are devoid of
&+Lmarkings for iris or pupil.&n
