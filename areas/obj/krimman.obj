Tucked into the corner formed by the two tall walls to the south and east, this
cracked fountain was once quite a beautiful piece.  Carefully carved fish have
been suspended over the bowl of the fountain as if they were leaping out of the
walls into the waters embrace.  No water flows here now though, and the water
that does remain in the bowl of the small fountain has turned to a slimy green
that is completely unfit for consumption.

Despite having spent untold years immersed in water, this fine weapon has not

of this type is extraordinarily rare, and only the finest of smiths are able
to work it.  The creator of this incredible sword certainly knew what they were
doing.  A small symbol on the blade near the hilt must be the mark of its
creator, but the name that went with the mark has been lost to history.  The
hilt has been wrapped in a soft leather that has clearly spent many years in
a wet place, the hilt will probably have to be replaced soon.

Woven of the finest pre-died wool, the carpet alone is worth a great deal of
money.  When the fine golden thread that has been used to stitch a beautiful
copy of Lord Krimeneha's Seal into the center of the rug is added, the rug
becomes a truely unique and valuable piece.

vault~
Powerful magic runes cover the door to the vault, making it clear that only the
proper key will be able to open it.  Even then, one wonders what traps may have
been set.  Based upon size alone, it would appear this vault could hold more
treasure then is stored in most banks, it is hard to determine what might
really be inside though.  Made with the greatest security in mind, it is
doubtful that a thief could open the vault even without its magical protection.

chain chainmail silver~
This beautiful silver armor is as light as it is sturdy, and has an elegance
that would stand out in any crowd.  The front of the armor has been colored
somehow, showing a dragon breathing and leaping out of the armor.  Magic was
clearly a large part of both the creation of the armor and the odd symbol of
the dragon, which appears to move when the armor moves.  It would be difficult
to put a price on a piece like this, but it was probably specially made as a
gift between wealthy families or partners.

Even though it has been double layered, the silk of the cloak is light and
airy.  Some magical treatment, no matter how slight, must have been used upon
its fragile fabric to protect it from tears as well as from the elements.  The
seal of Lord Krimeneha has been stitched into the lapel using dark purple
thread.  The seal is almost impossible to see from a distance, giving the cloak
a certain understated class.

his vault.

There is a darkness about it that is hard to define or understand, Lord
Eckraldu, though not a necromancer, has been known to dabble in dark magics,
and rumors say he has consorted with demons.  If such tales are true then this
staff may hold the key to great power, then again, it could also lead to a
swift death.

This fine sword, and its gold-trimmed hilt, is quite heavy, yet it cuts through
the air with ease.  Magic has been used to treat the silver blade, to give it
the strength to withstand everyday use, and the magical power to defeat even
the darkest of evil foes.  A symbol representing the god of justice has been
etched into both sides of the blade giving it a holy aura.

Magic has been used to force the water to stay together, even when it is set
out in the sun it doesn't evaporate.  The ring stretches and compresses easily,
yet touching and playing with it doesn't get one even damp.  Though its purpose
is unclear, it is certainly an interesting item for discussion.

Although this dagger was clearly designed to be a well-honed, effective
weapon, it is also clear that it is as much for show as it is for use.  It
is far more likely to be seen in the hands of a bard rather than anyone
else.  It is a beautiful weapon, its golden blade trimmed with silver
inlays and topped with an ivory pommel.  Gold, though valuable, doesn't
tend to stand up well to prolonged use so a dagger like this is mostly for
show.
