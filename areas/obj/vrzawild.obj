&+r.       Welcome to the        .&N
&+r.   Crystalspyre Mountains    .&N
&+r.                             .&N
&+r. This zone is eventually to  .&N
&+r. be the road to the fabeled  .&N
&+r. city of Verzanan. Until the .&N
&+r. city is completed, a high   .&N
&+r. level temporary encounter   .&N
&+r. will reside at the end of   .&N
&+r. the road. While all levels  .&N
&+r. are encouraged to try the   .&N
&+r. road and glacier, the final .&N
&+r. encounter is designed to be .&N
&+r. a challenge for level 40+   .&N
&+r. players. The road itself    .&N
&+r. will unfairly challenge all .&N
&+r. players below level 20.     .&N
&+r. Then again, I wouldn't want .&N
&+r. to disappoint you.          .&N
