axe cleaver~
   This large axe was crafted from the femer and clavicles of a drow warrior.
Its twin blades are wickedly serrated and set parallel to each other, in the
top of the femer.  Dried elf skin wraps around the base of the bone handle,
acting as a handgrip.  Two spiders in combat are carved on the bone of each
of the clavicle blades, giving the axe an overall image of macabre beauty.
