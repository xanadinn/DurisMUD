statue cyric destroyer~
   &+LThis large statue is crafted of pure diorite and stands nearly eight
&+Lfeet tall.  The fiery orange of the magma below causes the statue to
&+Lglow and flicker with horrific persistence.  Cyric the Destroyer, one
&+Lof the greater Gods of Faerun is a devilish humanoid warlord, who's
&+Lappetite for destruction and thirst for chaos has brought him to ultimate
&+Lpower and godliness.  The statue is carved of Cyric in a pose with his
&+Lhands raised up high and his head tilted back with a wild cackle on his
&+Lface.  His body covered in robes and villainous black armor.  The legend
&+Lof Cyric tells of his extremely chaotic and unpredictably ruthless
&+Lmanners as he eventually drove himself to insanity in the Year 87 on the
&+Lday of BloodLust.  It was also lored that on this day Cyric's powers
&+Lwent out of his own control along with his mind, and he caused a huge
&+Lmeteor shower onto the southern lands of Duris, and caused the entire
&+Lcontinent to become shifted and warped.  Cyric's body became that of
&+Lfire and power during this chaotic display of insanity and destruction,
&+Land ruptured a huge crater into the world of Duris, causing a massive
&+Llava flow to erupt and incinerate an entire realm of man.  The evil
&+Lnature and essence of Cyric was with the lava as it burned and overtook
&+Lthis civilization, and legend has it this entire realm was burnt,
&+Lincinerated, and by the evil powers of Cyric, caused to rise again with
&+La similar diabolic, bloodthirsty insanity that controlled Cyric during
&+Lhis most destructive, and most legendary latter years.
