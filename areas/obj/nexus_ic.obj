&+w     Sometime during the fight, the chest of this &+Wtroll&+w was broken open and&n
&+wthe &+rhea&+Rr&+rt&+w ripped out.  It must have been a strong blow, for &+Wtrolls&+w are very&n
&+wtough.  Breaking open its chest must not have been an easy chore.&n

ornate drinking horn~
&+y     This ornate drinking horn has runes etched into it.  It does not come from&n
&+yany natural beast, and it is impossible to even tell the base species that made&n
&+yit.  It seems to shine with a pearlescent luster, with an inner glow coming out&n
&+yfrom inside.   The runes squirm in the sight of any mortal, almost blinding any&n
&+ywho try to decipher them.&n
