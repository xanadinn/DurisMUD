|   Milton is a madman.  I write this <blot> <blot> hoping he will not     |
|   catch this solitary journal of truth.  <blot> <blot>  I feel Tomak     |
|   is dead ... and I don't think it was a mere accident that made         |

|                                                                           |
|   First week, Milton                                                      |
|   I've managed to find five others to help me find the crystal city the   |
|   old legends say are beyond these wastes.  I found the legends in the    |
|   ruins of a temple far away, in the middle of the wilderness.  These     |
|   others should prove helpful for a while.  When they've served their     |
|   purpose they can be discarded.  After all, there is only one treasure   |
|   worth having in the Crystal City.  And it will be *MINE*                |
|                                                                           |
|   Second week, Milton                                                     |
|   I confess I do not know exactly where the way is ... the old roads      |
|   have been swallowed up by the <blot> long ago.  But I lie to the others |
|   and they, gullible fools, believe me.  Except Tomak.  I believe he will |
|   be <blot>.  But he is easy enough to take care of.  Cyril grows more    |
|   desirable each passing hour, but she is modest in the presence of the   |
|   others.  That can be rectified easily enough.                           |

passage2~
|   Third week, <blot>                                                      |
|   I begin to wonder what Aberden writes in his notes.  The simpering      |
|   dandy was very useful in financing this venture.  But now his nasal     |
|   voice grates on mine ears.  He may be useful yet ... if only to give    |
|   to Michith when that great lout grows restless.  Gordas has been        |
|   so very useful when those damnable bugs attack ... but if he so much    |
|   as looks at me cross eyed I will tear his heart out and eat it.  I      |
|   *have* been hungry recently, after all.                                 |
|                                                                           |
|   End of Fourth Week, Milton                                              |
|   Tomak grumbled too much and was disposed of.  Gordas is apparently not  |
|   as colossally stupid as I thought.  Michith broke his neck.  Aberden,   |
|   the simp, is powerless.  Maybe it would be amusing to have Mict- <blot> |

|   With only Myself, aberden and michith around besides cyril, I found no  |
|   good reason behind her modesty, and so took her.  'twas entertaining.   |
|   Michith watches, which makes it <blot>.  Her screams are so beautiful.  |
|                                                                           |
|   Sixth week, Milton                                                      |
|   Michith killed Aberden last night.  Removed his head and poured his     |
|   blood on Cyril and mine entwined bodies.  Delicious!  I know the city   |
|   is somewhere near ... I can almost smell the legendary <blot>           |
|                                                                           |

|   I've found it!  A cave that *must* lead to the Crystal City!  The bitch |
|   Cyril ran away in the night, without her clothes and only a canteen.    |
|   She will not make it far.  Pity.  Michith was killed by a snake.  It    |
|   saves me the trouble of having to do it myself.  I write this just as I |

E
corpse milton~
The corpse is fairly well preserved, due to the dry air and the fact the
cave protects from the elements fairly well.  The corpse's fingernails are
broken, and the shards of a shattered sword lie near by, as if the man had
tried to dig through the solid stone wall before him.
