desk redwood~
&+y  Standing eight feet high this desk was obviously made for a giant, it is
&+ytwelve feet wide and six feet deep. At first glance the desk is rather simple
&+yappearing to have scuff marks on each of the drawers.  Upon closer
&+yexamination, intricate carvings and designs fill the enter front of the desk.
&+yDifferent shades of redwood form a calm, relaxing design across the desktop.
&+yEach leg is a perfectly carved into a round smooth finish.&N

&+ySwirls of geometric shapes are on all sides and run connected from side to

&+ythat of the top and bottom layer. There are no markings on this layer and
&+Ythe wood seems to a slightly lighter shade then that of the bottom and top.
&+YThe top portion, with half the height of the bottle and middle level, has a

pedestal~
&+rThis pedestal has three levels to its pyramid shape. The bottle level which
&+ris made for a very deep red wood, is perfectly square. On the sides are
&+rseveral artistic markings that don't appear to be any sort of language.
&+ySwirls of geometric shapes are on all sides and run connected from side to
&+yside. The second layer is set up so the grain of the wood is perpendicular to
&+ythat of the top and bottom layer. There are no markings on this layer and
&+Ythe wood seems to a slightly lighter shade then that of the bottom and top.
&+YThe top portion, with half the height of the bottle and middle level, has a
&+Ysmall plaque engraved with the words...

               &+YPlease donate &+ycopper &+Yinto the statue.
