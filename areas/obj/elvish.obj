statue lloth queen spider~
&+wThis statue seems almost lifelike, the craftsmanship that has been wrot to make such a work is hardly
concievable. The fountain itself seems to flow out of her outstreched hand and down the tip of her outreached
fingers.

       &+LLittle spi&+md&+Lers dart and scurry around her head. The &+wstatue &+Lhas long flowing hair and it seems that the drow part of the statue is one of the mostly beautiful women you have ever seen, as you work your way down the spi&+md&+Ler legs an almost homage to the contrast between beauty and otherwise.
