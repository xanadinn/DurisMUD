badge scalp~
&+L  This is the symbol of *&+r-&+L* &+rCarnage &+L*&+r-&+L* ...
&+LOn the front side of the badge is a blood-red skull on a pitch-black
&+Lbackground.  Behind the red skull are two crossed bones, white in
&+Lcolor.  This symbol has been tanned on to a small piece of elven
&+Lscalp.  On the reverse side of the badge is a small pin used to
&+Lattatch the badge.  The pin is made of a tarnished gnome finger.
&+LThe entire badge weighs less than a pound.  This skull and crossed
&+Lbones symbol is legendary, and often tanned in to the scalps of
&+Lvictims.  The best killers of the guild have the badge colors reversed,
&+Lwhere the background is red and the skull is pitch-black.
