staff broken~
What used to be a black wooden staff is now in two pieces, and glows with a
dim but noticeable golden aura. The staff is slightly warm, especially the
metal shod ends. A gold-colored liquid drips from the break in the middle,

The saber's blade has a steel core, but has been coated with a thin layer of

and forms a mount for a small emerald in the pommel. The sabers decoration
does nothing to dispel its lethal intent, for it is perfectly balanced, and
its keen edge seems almost anxious to spill a foes blood.
