from when they first moved into the underdark, outcast by the mountain
dwarves and first dug out their first civilizations.  King StoutDorf
was one of those dwarves, and so he spent 20 years foring this great
battleaxe, to slay those who had betrayed him.

crown~
    The crown of King StoutDorf, forged at the same time as his battleaxe
called 'DorfSlayer' was another one of his crowning achievments that
brought him to be the military leader of the underdark of all time. Having
faced off against the good hordes on the surface in such places as the
Transparent Tower, and fighting off the guards at Kimordril with his army,
he has seen it all, and thus been crowned king.
