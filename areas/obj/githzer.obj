standing in a battle pose, his sword raised up high.  A strange sensation
of &+Lfear &Nand &+Lmeakness &Nsweeps over you just from gazing at this figure.
Either the master craftsman who chiseled this statue exaggerated the
size greatly, or this particular Githzerai warlord was much taller and
stronger then normal.  Huge muscles buldge out through his platemail and
beneath his robes.  A large battle helmet rests above his brow
   Even through the stone and metal of the statue, a piercing &+rflame&N can

looking githzerai warrior.  The statue is about eight feet tall,
which is much taller then the average githzerai.  This warrior
does not wear anywhere near as much armor as the others, but,
however, appears to be twice as strong with rippled &+mveins&N and
bulging muscles covering his body.  The craftsman who captured
this frenzied githzerai warrior in this pose truely is a master
artisan.  Various droplets of &+Rblood &Non the warrior's hands, face,
and arms are depicted as tiny &+rbloodstones&N, perfectly sized and
placed into position.
   Although still set in statue, a ruthless and frenzied &+Wstare&N of

&+Lstare.  The great githzerai blood warrior, Kraange Xarvyn, stands with
&+Lhis tribe of blood warriors, laying brutal siege across the land.
