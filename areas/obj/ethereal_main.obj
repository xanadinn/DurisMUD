are smooth but uneven looking naturally formed.  This place is obviously

The rift is about 100 feet in diameter and seems to shimmer.
As you look into the rip an image slowly takes form!
The blurred image in the rift is one of a huge cliff wall rising hundreds
of feet into the air.  At the cliff's base a one hundred foot circular hole
tunnels into the sheer wall of rock.  The hole seems to absorb all light
and a small trail of smoke rises into the air out of it.  There is a small sign
near the hole though it is too blurred to make out what it reads.  The
language that the sign is written in is barely discernable the language
of the dragons.  And as if to exemplify the point there are hundreds of
large dragon tracks leading to and from the hole...
