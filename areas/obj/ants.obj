corpse~
&+L   This corpse has been severly mutilated.  Its eyes have been torn out,&n
&+Lseveral of its legs severed, and its antennae ripped off.  A collection&n
&+Lof aggressive scratch marks expose the innards of this mangled ant, its&n
&+Lcorpse long frozen into a still death.  Simply looking at the corpse&n
&+Lfills one with sadness and mourning. In fact, it's making you
&+Lwant to "cry" over it.&n
