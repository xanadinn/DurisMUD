small book~
This small book seems to have an infinate amount of pages.  As it is paged
through, it always seems to have another page unturned.

The pages seem to describe the history of what has happened to the citadel
over time, and thicker pages seem to match up with important events.

Several pages are of interest...

Near the front of the book, a passage reads:
"...and in reward for slaying so many of the living, and bringing to undead
to the prime material plane, The Lord of All Undead, the Demon Prince, Orcus,
forged a mightly castle of the purest obsidian for the great necromancer
Larcain'u Ghulan. The citadel served as conduit of energies from the
negative plane and Larcain'u served as the a focus. Orcus promissed Larcain'u
that as long as no creature on The Prime Material Plane was not more devoted
to bringing to legions of the living dead to this world that he would remain
lord over the Obsidian Citadel, perhaps the most impervious fortress in the
land."

Later on, about 1/3 of the way through the book...

"....Orcus rejected Larcain'u Ghulan in favor of his apprentice, Satar Ghulan
who had become more commited to Orcus' cause by becoming a Lord of Undead
himself -- a vampire.  Control of the citadel shifted to Satar."

At the end of the book, a few other entries are of note:

"On the day of bloodlust, a party of 10 paladins and one cleric from the north,
the lands controlled by the good races, came to slay Lord Ghulan.  After a
long fight, Lord Ghulan and his minions, vampires and undead, emerged
victorious.  Although many minions died and could not be raised again because
of the damage caused by the paladin's holy weapons, Lord Ghulan gained 10 new
death knights devoted to him.  Lord Ghulan, unable to destroy the holy weapons,
had them moved to a safe location, under the citadel, where there disruptive
effects could be muted."

"And the foolish thief moved into the heavily trapped ancient library, and was
instantly envelopped in a..."

This enormous chest looks like it could hold massive amounts.  Seeing as it
holds the hoard of the great shadowdragon Kaketkralix it probably makes good

elven green chainmail chain mail full suit~
This chainmail suit is of the highest quality, and it is no doubt that Lord
Ghulan had to fight to get it. The craftsmanship is utterly flawless, with
the links being identical and perfectly spaced.  Furthermore, the individual
links have been wrapped in silk causing the chainmail to make little noise
when the wearer moves. The armor alows excellent movement, leaving the user
almost virtually unhindered.

This massive flamberge is of ancient make.  It has a metal with an odd
blueish-purple tint to it and seems to be rather well tempered for something
so ancient.  On the down-side, the metal is rather heavy, but the weapon
is sure to drive fear into the heart of an enemy.

madhu dagger~
The madhu is a bizzare weapon.  Consisting of a buckler shield sized basket
guard with a 4 inch spike sticking out , with a 6 inch blade jutting out
the "bottom" and an 18 inch blade jutting out the top, it makes for a weapon
that is extremely effective for defense, and extremely annoying to fight
against, as attacks made with it are bizzare when compared to typical sword
and dagger attacks. Unfortunately, due to its unusual nature, it is difficult
to strike powerfully, and even though it is easy to land a hit with it,
the blows are not especially damaging.
