pillar pillars~
   &+wCarved pillars, &+Lobsidian&n like everything else here, hold up the weight
of the &+gsurface world&+w. A &+Wletter&+w is carved on each pillar, '&+BH&+w' on the
north eastern pillar, '&+BA&+w' on the north western, '&+BL&+w' on the south western,
and '&+BK&+w' on the south eastern. Perhaps it is some indication of who created
this place?

altar~
&+w   This massive &+Lobsidian&+w altar sits in the center of the cavern. The
&+bdetailed carvings&+w covering every part of it are perhaps beyond &+rmortal&+w
ability. What purpose it serves is unknown.

carving carvings detailed~
&+w Carvings cover most of the wall space here. They are carved into the wall
and inlaid with &+Lgranite&+w. They portray battle scenes, perhaps past or
future from &+LT&+Wh&+Le &+WV&+Lo&+Wi&+Ld&+w. One shows a massive &+Lmino&+rtaur&+w member headbutting and
cracking open an &+Bogre's&+w skull like a &+gmelon&+w. Another shows a large battle with
&+WV&+Lo&+Wi&+Ld&+w members fighting a &+Cfive-headed &+Rdragon&+w. &+WPaladins&+w defend the physically
weaker &+MMages&+w while making great slashes with massive swords. &+cClerics&+w heal the
wounded while calling down the fury of their &+WGod&n on the evil beast. The &+MMages&+w
bend reality itself and invoke powerful magics summoning huge &+Yfists&+w to beat on
the dragons tough hide, surround the valiant heroes in stone and cause &+rclouds&+w
of blistering hot &+Rheat&+w to pass through the battle. While &+CShamen&+w and &+gDruids&+w bend
the very forces of &+Gnature&+w and the &+Celements&+w against the terrific beast. However
most of the carvings are of battles with evil races who dwell in the
&+MUnder&+mdark&n and sneak out at night to pick on the weak. Throughout the various
scenes one theme is apparent, &+LT&+Wh&+Le &+WV&+Lo&+Wi&+Ld&+w is a truly formidable force.
