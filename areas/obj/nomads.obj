These jet-black pants are made out of a material similar to silk, but
providing more protection. They are fastened with a simple drawstring,
which is the blue-green color of the Cimmerians and of the same material.

stick sword training~
Cimmerians normally fight unarmed, but in the earliest stages of their
training learn to fight with these simply constructed swords. While made
of only hardwood, rather than metal, they still do their job quite nastily,
encouraging youg Cimmerians to learn techniques of avoidance very early on.

headband black~
It is said that in ancient times the Cimmerians were granted a dozen gifts
from their god Winduin, potent magical items that increased the already-
fearsome skill of those Cimmerians that had walked the Master's Path. This
is obviously one of those items, as the X-and-O symbol of the Cimmerians and
the tangible aura of magic surrounding the otherwise plain headband suggest.
It is said also that such an item will not last long, away from the Masters
for whom it is intended...

From the X-and-O symbol on the sash, and the strange glowing aura that
surrounds it, one can guess that this is one of the twelve gifts that
Winduin bestowed upon the Cimmerian ancients to augment their fighting
skills. It reeks of magical power, but the legends suggest the such
items cannot be held long by one who is not of Cimmerian blood.

page1~
&+c"&+wTwo strangers came to the camp today. I don't like their complexion or their
temperament, and I harbor suspicions that they carry a little Orcish blood
in their veins. They approached Septimus and offered their services as
craftsmen; the runty one, it seems, is a woodworker, and the lanky one does
*something* with iron, I don't know what. Being the cautious, prudent man
that he is, Septimus immediately accepted, and ordered us to empty two of
the wagons for their use! I don't like this one bit, but I can't for the
life of me imagine what to do about it.&+c"

&+c"&+wMy fears have been realized. Today Septimus announced that we would be
halting our travels indefinitely, so as to allow the newcomers a better
working environment. What have they done, to cause our leader to blaspheme
Winduin in this manner? A pall has fallen over the entire camp; it is as
though the will of my people is being drained, overshadowed by these new
presences. I no longer even feel safe writing in this journal, and keep it
hidden deep in one of the storage wagons. I shall update the journal soon,
but for now, I go to confront this so-called 'ironworker' and find out what
it is he's really up to.&+c"

Poor Rellius seems to have been the target of a disintegrate spell. That he

Most 'diamond' rings are a band of metal imbedded with one or more small

of the precious mineral. Some artisan with ungodly skill managed to carve
the X-and-O symbol of the Cimmerian nomads into a pattern running around
the outside of the ring. This indicates that the ring is probably meant to
enhance fighting skill, a gift from Winduin to his people.
