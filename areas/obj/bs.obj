Each spring, the petkeepers of the Shargaas Pet shop in Bloodstone
go trapping manticore cubs in the Svalich woods.  The pet shop
nurses these manticores into very formidable and highly loyal
pets.  Being plucked from their lair at such a young age, allows
the manticore to be properly trained.  The shop will guarantee
a health score of &+W135&N points.  It is able to make this claim
because of the strict diet, and warm lovin' given to each of the
shop's cubs.  In addition to having an impressive Shargaas defensive
rating of &+W15&N, the manticore has been trained to be a mount!
The manticore will gladly transport you through the difficult trails
of the Svalich region.  Much like his fierce cousin, the manticore
has an equally deadly attack.  His Shargaas offensive rating is
&+W10&N and can deliver damage ranging from &+W6&N to &+W20&N points.
The manticore by far is the most well rounded companion for the
price.
Warning:Do not introduce this animal to good races.

Stirge can be found in most parts of the Svalich woods.  Though
plentiful, not too much information is available.  Their health
range varies and is quite irratic.  However, through many
experiments, the stirge has been found to be very capable
of causing significant damage.  Their long beaks are able to pierce
with an average damage of &+W10&N points.  Tests are still being
performed to determine how the stirge fairs in combat, but this
information was not made available at the time of publishing.
Initial tests reveal that the stirge seems to be a deadly companion.
