journal language kobold~
There isn't much left readible of the journal.  Most of the pages have
been torn out or vandalized.  There is one page which can still be seen
fairly well... The page of text reads:
   The language of the kobolds seems to remarkably similar to that of
common.  In fact the language seems to be more like an encryption of
common words; the letters of common words can be replaced with the
kobold equivilant to create kobold words.... the structure and
integrity is kept completely.  Interesting language...
   The punctuation which the kobolds follow are periods and comas; other
punctuation points are not known, or actually used as symbols
representing letters.  Sometimes '!!' is used to mean an exclamation,
but is not used often in the writen (albeit small as it is) portion of
the ancient kobold language.  All letters seem to be of a uniform case
or size as well
   Unfortunately I only have been able decipher some of the letters
meanings, those of which I have been able to discover follow bellow:
   In common: "e"  means "uu" in kobold
[The page is ripped at this point and unreadable]
