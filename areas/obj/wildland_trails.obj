crate storage wooden~
This huge crate is similar to those used by many merchant caravans to
house fragile goods during overland shipment. Burned into the wood,
you recognize a seal of a Daggerford based merchant company which
used to do business through these parts. Several large padlocks are
placed about the crate, making you wonder the value of whatever could
be inside.

This small pouch hold various herbs, bones, stones and ointments which
are representative of the spirits. By wearing an intact medicine bag,
many barbarians believe the person will be protected from injury by
the kindly spirits. To remove its sacred contents would destroy the
power stored in it by the tribal shaman.

axe hunting stone hand~
This hand axe has a finely chiseled stone head which is surprisingly
sharp and lethal, while its shaft is made from strong wood bound with
animal hide strips. Additional hide strips and stone rings have been
used in places to balance the axe for throwing. From the painted
markings, it appears many of the barbarians have had these axes
blessed by the local shaman, asking for success in hunting and combat.
