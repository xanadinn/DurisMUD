&+BThe pond is surrounded by reeds. It is rather small, and its surface is covered
&+Bwith leaves, but it is still a haven for insects, birds and small mammals. Many

&+Bpredators. They seem to ignore you however, and must be accustomed to villagers
&+Bfrom the nearby town. Occasional ripples hint at fishes swimming in its water.&N
