&+Lbeen etched into its tail.  Perhaps this is here for a reason, or perhaps it&N
&+Lsimply is another relic from the past.  Sounds of battle start to fade into&N
&+Lyour mind, the cries for mercy do not matter.  You start to see women slayed&N
&+Lalongside their children.  A dark figure is upon a hill and stares at you with&N
&+Lhis &+Rglowing &+Ldread red eyes.  The being does not seem to have a face yet it is&N
&+Lthere filling your soul with despair.  The &+wDea&+Lth &+wD&+Lealer sits on top of a black&N
&+Lsteed, perhaps a n&+bightma&+Lre.  For you know that this is worse than any, because&N
&+Lyou know it to be real.  Birds of pray circle the darkened evil &+wsky &+Lwaiting to&N

&+L   This dark magenta colored &+minsignia &+Ldoes not seem to be one that is of the&N

&+Lliving just to fight.  Serve the &+revil &+Ltill the day of no longer, worship the&N
&+Lmaster or die.  &+mDarkuul &+Lis the dark lord who shall deliver us from the hordes&N
&+Lof &+Chumans&+L.  The &+Ydwarves &+Lshall be tossed as they always have been, as in the now&N
&+Land what becomes the past.  Words of wisdom no longer hold meaning in the realm&N
&+Lof mortals.  Those that seem to be &+WImmortal &+Lmust kill all who dare to stand in&N
&+Ltheir way.  Mercy is for the meek who shall be given nothing and all shall be&N
&+Ltaken from them.  Power creates the rules, hiding in the shadows the goodies&N
&+Llurk in their pathetic groups.  Men of twenty yet not even to have one, all for&N
&+Lthemselves and nothing for the all.  Reality starts to fade into your eyes and&N

&+Lyour brain from the nine hells of the infernal plane.  Dreams of the lost are&N
&+Lforever to be no longer.  Screams of torment ring out within your head, yes&N
&+Lfilling you with dread.  The wings of this beast span at least eighteen feet&N
&+Lacross and have stains of dried crimson on them.  The claws of terror also have&N

&+L   This dark magenta colored &+minsignia &+Ldoes not seem to be one that is of the&N

&+Lthe true might.  Only those with the sight can ever see, never to be right,&N
&+Lliving just to fight.  Serve the &+revil &+Ltill the day of no longer, worship the&N
&+Lmaster or die.  &+mDarkuul &+Lis the dark lord who shall deliver us from the hordes&N
&+Lof &+Chumans&+L.  The &+Ydwarves &+Lshall be tossed as they always have been, as in the now&N
&+Land what becomes the past.  Words of wisdom no longer hold meaning in the realm&N
&+Lof mortals.  Those that seem to be &+WImmortal &+Lmust kill all who dare to stand in&N
&+Ltheir way.  Mercy is for the meek who shall be given nothing and all shall be&N
&+Ltaken from them.  Power creates the rules, hiding in the shadows the goodies&N
&+Llurk in their pathetic groups.  Men of twenty yet not even to have one, all for&N
&+Lthemselves and nothing for the all.  Reality starts to fade into your eyes and&N
