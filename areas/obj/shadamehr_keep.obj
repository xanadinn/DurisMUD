sword unholy avenger bloodlust~
&+rThis is the mighty sword of a powerful death knight.  The heavy weapon has
&+rbeen created with a bright red, razor sharp blade and a pitch black metal
&+rpommel.  Archaic runes flow down the edge of the blade, etched into the
&+rmetal and colored differently by the heat.  The pommel fits securely upon
&+rthe tang of the blade, sliding over and into a notch to lock the weapon
&+rtogether.&N
