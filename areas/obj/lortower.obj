mid-thirites and looks to have been dead for about a day or so. His throat has
been cut and he has been impailed on a black steel pike that is rusted.
Nailed to his chest with a iron spike is a large note written on parchment
paper that looks like it has been taken out of a book. The note has been
written in fresh &n&+rblood &nand reads:


&+r              I told ye people to
&+r            leave me be and I would

go attempt to open his prision. You may go ahead and start your offensive
against Tharnadia, I will join you when I am done here. With the might of
Sargon again on our side and their god all but forgotten, we shall surely
crush all those sent against us. Also, remember that you agreed to march on
Ghore with me. The betrayl the trolls of ghore fave us shall be revisited

&+L   Dear Kinslor,


&+L   My old friend it is good to hear from you. I had heard that you were
&+Lworking toward the raising of your ancient god. From what I get hear
&+Lit seems to be going well. You ask what I would do if you attacked from
&+Lyour area, would I back you, or fight you. My friend if you succeed in raising
&+Lyour fallen god then i think my decision would be to help you. The only
&+Lproblem in this area would be Duke Delwyn. He has an area close by here,
&+Lbut I think toegether we can take him. I hope to see you over his cold dead
&+Lcorpse.

&+L                                        The Baron of &n&+rBloodstone&n

&+C   This hammer seems to be made of the finest mithril. The mithril is made
&+Cin designs that show creatures that seems to made of shadows being destroyed.
&+CThe figure doing the destroying is a being bathed in golden light that is
&+Cwielding a sword of fire on them. The grip is made of solid steel, and is
&+Cwrapped in what looks to be fine leather.
&+C   This weapons story is old and is quite grand. Givin to the dwarven cleric
&+CDrogan during the Wars of Light and Shadow by the Goddess Raanna he wielded
&+Cit in the destruction of many minions of Sargon. During the last days of the
&+Cwar a small group of adventurers broke into the fortress and snuck past its
&+Cmost powerful defenders, including Maltheas, the angel of Death, and the
&+CMaster of Nightmares, and even Earlion, one of the most pwoerful mages on the
&+Cplane. They snuck into Sargon's personal area and there had a titanic battle.
&+CFinally, unable to kill them they impisoned him away in a pocket diminsion,
&+Chowever just as they finished Sargons minions and his army arrived to destroy
&+Cthem, Drogan bought the rest of the group time to flee, while he single
&+Chandedly fought off the army. The hammer has been lost since then, some say
&+Cit was destroyed, others say that it fell into the hands of the minions of
&+CSargon.                               &n

   'Today the three masters along with Lord Urian began the spell
   to bring back the Black Tower from the place which Is Not.

   5-24
   'They finished the spell today, but many are saying something
   went wrong. I was talking to the Master and he said that the
   Tower had been in that place between moments in time. And that
   when they brought it back There had been a time shift, he said
   it should only affect living things though, unliving things or
   objects should be safe.

   6-12
   'We finally opened the door into our level of the fortress, and
   found the statue of Earlion. Lord Urian as in shock, he had no
   idea that he was here still after all these years. However I
   think that he worries the temporal shifts may have seriously
   affected Earlion.

   6-15
   'The three masters have just finished getting the keys to open
   the ancient mage Earlion's door. They belive that the statue
   of him in the hallway has the key itself, and he needs the
   Three tokens before he will give it up.

   6-18
   'The day has come, today Sargon will come back to us, and we will
   march all over the face of earth. Soon they will release Earlion
   from his room, they need his key desperately to open Sargon's
   prison.      &n

   did this I do not know, it seems he wanted to make sure none but
   the most powerful could get to it. To get the key we need to travel
   into the positive energy plane itself. Not much of it, thank Sargon,
   because that would mean our death, but simply far enough to reach
   the power source...."

   us. I hope we are correct, because without it, we will never be able

crown sorcerer king~
&+m   This crown is what actually caused the ancient war of Light and Shadow.
&+mLong before the wars, before there was Toril, before there was Duris, before
&+mthere was Basternae there were many gods, and few heros. These were the days
&+mof legends. At this time there was a powerful sorcerer named Thindal Darkenion.
&+mHe was allready king over a huge area. However, he yearned for more, so he
&+mmade pacts with an infernal power, Sargon, the Lord of Shadows. He gave his
&+msoul over to the dark lord, and Sargon gave him powers, minions, and this
&+mcrown to seal their pact. It was thereafter called the Crown of the Sorcerer
&+mKing.
&+m    Thindal fought a powerful war versus the forces of light, and finally in
&+mhis dying breadth, as the forces of good entered his castle and his cities,
&+mhe opened a breach between our world and Sargon's. He put a crack in the
&+mbarrier that keeps the two areas apart. It was this crack that Sargon
&+mexploited a thousand years later to come to our world and wreck destruction.&n

&+r   This long whip is made of the souls of the dead that have been impirioned

&+rmagic of hate and destruction. It was created by the powerful demonic
&+rsorcerer Girthil, the Insane. He created it for his most prized balor guard,
&+rbefore he was ruthlessly killed and eaten by the same guard as his succubus
&+rmistress looked on in joy. The ancient tale is told on the prime matierial
&+rplane to sorcerers who think they can deal with demons, and is told in the
&+rabyss as a joke.&n

corpse martin sorcerer llewellyn&n~
   This is the corpse of one of the most poweful &n&+msorcerers&n that has ever
lived. He grew up in the ancient elven city of &n&+gVel&+Gya&n&+gdin&n, on the western coast
in the time of&+W Legends&n. His mother was the&+W Silver &n&+gLady&n, the most
powerful minion of &+WCerro&n, the &+WSilver Dragon &+LGod. &nHis father was Ilvin Dealth,
another plane traveleing sorcerer. When the &n&+rwars &nof &+WLight &nand &+LShadow &ncame he
kept himself aloof from them, prefering to live in &n&+gVe&+Gly&n&+gadin&n, the city he loved.
When he came back from the planer adventure he found his beloved town laid
to waste, its people killed, and the city givin over to &n&+gdemons&n. &+WMartin &nswore
that he would see &+LSargon&n pay for that. In the next ten years he constructed
the &+LPrison &nof &+CE&+Bx&n&+bi&+Bl&+Ce&n, a pocked diminsion from which there was no escape. When
&+LSargon&n was thrust here, there was one catch. One person had to stay and seal
the prision away, and the &+Levil&n god himself, forever. &+WMartin&n decided that he
would stay here. &n&+MTime&n passes strangely here, there is no telling how long
he lived here, awayting his time to &n&+rdie&n. Some say that his &+Csoul&n lives on,
even it unable to escape the prison of his creation... who now can tell...
for that is a tale for another &+Lday&n.&+C.&+W.&n

   Opening the spellbook you see that the first page has been written in
allready. It reads the following.

   Greetings and Well Met,

      If you are here then I pray that you are soldiers of Light and not the
   Darkness. If so then I have important information that you will need. I
   realize that my prison will not last forever, but it should serve long
   enough so that when you will have gotten here Sargon will be weakened,
   and therefore killable. You must know some things to be able to go
   farther and succeed. First, once you go in, you CANNOT get out. It is
   impossible. You may leave from here... now. But that is the only way,
   this room should have been opened to the normal travel spells upon my
   death. There are seperate prisons here, when we imprisoned Sargon, we
   also imprisoned his elite guards, so you must fight through them on
   your way to Sargon. I do not know what is ahead more then one room,
   although i can tell you that His personal demonic bodyguard is in the
   next room.
