obelisk gray stone~
The gray stone is shadowy and has a strange magical sheen to it.  Runes along
its four sides are uninterpretable, it is clearly far older than anything
around it.  In fact, it appears to extend far into the ground, having stood
here so long that the earth has climbed upward to engulf it.  Exactly what it
is, or why it is here is impossible to say, but it is clear that the thorn men
worship it as a god.  The stone itself appears to respond to their odd chants,
humming with an inner life of its own.

Massive thorns, clearly taken from the largest of trees and bushes in the
forest, have been interwoven to create this strange throne.  No effort has been
made to keep the barbed tips away from the seat or the back of the throne,
anyone sitting in it had better be well-armored, or otherwise impervious to
the sharp thorns.
