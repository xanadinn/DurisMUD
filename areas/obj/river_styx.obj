horn bone crafted~
This huge horn is nearly three feet in length and apparently carved from
a solid piece of bone which you do not recognize. It tapers from a one
inch hole on the small end to a two foot hole on the larger end. A fine
silver chain, glowing with a pulsing blue light, attaches the horn to
a massive wooden post and defies all attempts at pulling the bone horn
free of its place on the pole. A faint inscription can also be seen on
the outside surface of the horn.
~
E
inscription writing~
The inscription reads:

"Mortal travelers within these desolate realms need but sound the
 Horn of the river to call forth the boatkeeper. But be prepared
 to pay his fee, for travelling the raging waters of the River
 Styx is not without its cost....and its risks.... "

Made from soild adamantium and inlaid with glowing red runes, this key is
obviously magical. One can also feel the very evil of the object issuing
forth from the runes, enchantments used for some insideous purpose no
doubt. Bits of river muck still cling to the key, absolutely refusing to
be cleaned away.

Soft white pearl makes up the material of this fountain, in stark contrast
to its dark ale contents. Sprays of the ale shoot upward before crashing
over the edges of the four foot diamater basin and falling to the floor.
Once on the floor, the ale seems to come to life as it flows together to
form a glowing pool.

As you look more closely at the bones, you can see sharp ridgids along
the knuckles and the bones seem to slowly..move.
