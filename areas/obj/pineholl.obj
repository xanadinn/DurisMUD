fountain~
Strangely enough, this fountain seem almost as old as the ancient trees
that surround it.  The water within glimmers with a rainbow of colors,
colors that come from within rather than reflections or refractions of
light from outside the water.  There is something magical about this
fountain, though the water within looks safe enough to drink, there is
something odd about it that would suggest travelers take great caution
before taking more than a sip.

It is clear that whatever killed the logger was incredibly poweful.
His chest has been caved in by a powerful blow and his neck has been
broken.  Oddly enough, although there are no insects in the area now,
bug bites cover the entire corpse, as if it was being devoured by some
horde of ants or other insects.  His bug-bitten face has a frozen
expression of horror, whatever killed him killed him swiftly and
brutally.

most likely that somebody negotiated with a dragon to obtain one of its
larger scales.  A good dwarven blacksmith could create wonderful armor

boots~
These boots are still new, the stiff leather hasn't had time to soften
yet.  Boots this inflexible are almost impossible to wear for long,
though they do provide good protection for the feet and ankles.  The
leather is so stiff that it would take a long period of wearing them to
soften them to wear they are comfortable and they are so plain that is
hard to decide if it would be worth the pain.

The long, thin horn from an ancient dragon's head has as much value as a weapon
as it does as a trophy.  Such horns are only as good as long as the dragon they
are from is still alive.  This means that this horn was deliberately removed
by the dragon itself and given away, a rare occurrence indeed.  The horn is more
like a 3 foot long spike, extremely thin along its entire length.  It has a
powerful magic however, the magic of the armor of dragons themselves.  Despite
its narrowness, it is far stronger then the strongest metals, flexing when it
needs to and withstanding any blow that is brought down upon it.

sword~
This beautifully crafted weapon has faint engravings along both sides of
its blade.  One one side of the blade there is the swirling symbol of the
god of wind and rain, one of the gods of good.  Upon the other side are
the words;
     &+C"To be used by the holy, for only they may be blessed."&N

The blade has a beauty that goes beyond words, and a magical aura that
fills anyone who views it with wonder.  The blade itself quivers with
power, eager to be used.
