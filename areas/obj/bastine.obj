To Phex:

     You are in charge of keeping the prisoner fed, and that is
     all. You are confined to this area because of the secret
     that you carry with you. Use the key only if the prisoner
     gets unruly. You know that the Prince has always been an
     embarrassment for me, and I wish to keep his dignity as
     well as the dignity of the crown. His grotesque and beastly
     appearance would not go well with the Volheru subjects.
     I entrust you with this information, as I will have your
     head if you divulge it.

King Mrotha.
