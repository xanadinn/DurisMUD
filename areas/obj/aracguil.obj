jewel globe~
This globe of pure darkness has been cut like a very precious gemstone. It
has hundreds of facets, and by guessing at its origin, one can futher
propose that the number is indeed six hundred and sixty six. The orb
itself has been attached to a rod made from the dreadwood tree of Pazuz
by a chain of the outerworld metal galernin.
