tree~
   &+LThe branches of this dark tree bear no leaves, and stretch at odd
angles towards the sky.  The wood has a dark, almost black coloration
to it.  The trunk is thick, almost ten feet in diameter.  Something
&+ybrown&+L seems to be hanging from one thick branch.&N
~
E
something brown~
   &+yThe something appears to be a section of rope tied to the tree.
The tree has, in fact, grown up around the rope almost obscuring it
from view.  Only small whisps of strands hang down slightly under the
branch.&N
