It is probably used by bandits during raids and would offer good protection
against many attacks. It is quite hard to breath in it though and may cause
its user to suffer in his eye hand coordination slightly.

book diary~
Most of the stuff in this book is boring and not very important. However
upon a longer inspection several articles written in common take your
interest....

...that bastard halfling escaped the slave pen! Not only this but he
stole the serpentine dagger i had kept in my desk and slew ten men
while escaping! That halfling can burn in the nine hells for what he did
his act of theft now prevents me from being able to loot the treasure
hoard kept inside Mt. Sknak near Ice Crag. I have sent out several scouting
parties to hunt the halfling down though i doubt they will succeed.

...it has been two weeks and finally one of the five scouting parties
I sent out has returned. That accursed halfling somehow made it off this
continent and is now hiding in a forest near the Shady orc settlement. That
scum has some nerve living so close to those disgusting beasts. An attempt
to kidnap him was foiled as a mixed band of orcs ogres and trolls killed
most of the scouts before they could succeed in getting the serpentine
dagger back. I might as well forget about it now I am not getting that
dagger back and now someone else will very well end up looting the
treasure in Mt. Sknak...
