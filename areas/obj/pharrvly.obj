paper wad~
You unwad the ball of paper and carefully smooth it out to read it.
It says:

&+y+---------------------------------------+&n
&+y:       &+RThe old farmer was here!        &+y:&n
&+y:       &+YHe has taken the contents       &+y:&n
&+y: &+Yof the chest into protective custody. &+y:&n
&+y+---------------------------------------+&n

Frustrated, you crumple the paper back into a wad.
