  To change the color of text, certain codes are placed before the text whose
  color you want to change.

  To change the foreground color, use the code &+X, where X is one of the
  following color codes:

    b - blue
    c - cyan
    r - red
    g - green
    y - yellow
    m - magenta
    l - black/grey
    w - grey/white

  You can use a brighter version of the same color by using the capital letter.
  (&+l is black and &+L is dark grey, &+w is grey and &+W is white.)

  For instance, to set text to bright green, you would use &+G, such as 'a 
  &+Gtree&n', or for even more color, 'a &+gtr&+Gee&n'

  The &n code can be used to reset text to grey on black (the default colors).
  This is automatically done at the start of every line.

  You can also use the &-X code to set the background or &=XY to set both the
  foreground and the background.
