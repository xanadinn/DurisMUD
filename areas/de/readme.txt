    This file contains the basic information you need to use durisEdit -
    read on and enjoy.


    Loading/creating zones -

      Just type "DE <zonename>".  If the .WLD, .ZON, .OBJ, or .MOB files
      don't exist, they will be created, do not fear.  All is good.

      Under Windows, just double-click DE (de.exe).  You will be prompted
      to create a zone.

    Getting acquainted quickly -

      To see the wonderful options durisEdit has to offer, try typing
      "config," "disp," and "checkc" within the editor.

      A brief command list can be viewed by typing "?"; to see a more
      detailed command list, type "HELP".  You can see a complete list
      of all commands by typing "COMMANDS" (alas, this list has no
      categorization or general help).

      If you don't want to read through the command list in DE.DOC
      command-by-command in order to figure out the arguments and what
      order they go in, try typing the command name and then gibberish
      for arguments at the prompt; most commands should let you know their
      syntax.


    Finally, there are some things in durisEdit that are not obvious,
    but that can help things along immensely.  Thus, the docs (DE.DOC)
    are probably required reading, in the end.
