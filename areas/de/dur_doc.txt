WELCOME TO AREA MAKING FOR DURIS MUD
-------------------------------------
Many people have come forward interested in writing areas for Duris.  Enough
changes have been made to the code and ‘flags’ over the past few months that it
is time to update these docs a bit.  The most recent set of docs was
written/modified by Zarland, much of what he wrote, and what was written in
previous docs for Sojourn/Toril remains unchanged.  What has changed a great deal
are some of the ‘flags’ that help identify the properties of rooms, mobs, and
objects.  As you read over these docs, please keep in mind that the coders at
Duris are constantly changing and adding code to continually improve the mud
and that some of these changes will lead to changes in the writing of areas.

The first step in preparing to write an area is probably to read over these docs,
and to download the latest version of the DE (the area editor written by Tavril)
from duris.mi.org /pub.  As described below, there are numerous ways to write
areas, the editor is the EASIEST way to at least TEST your area files.  Although
you do not need to use the DE, if you can use it to test your area this will help
save the gods responsible for loading it and looking it over a great deal of time
and effort.  Basically, if your files won’t load in the de, they won’t load on
the game.

Once you have looked over the docs, and hopefully at the de, you can decide
whether you really wish to write an area.  If so, then you should send a message
to Tavril (tavril@duris.mi.org), the god in charge of areas, with a good
description of your proposed area, what levels you wish to write it for, and a
general idea of where you would like to put it.  This will allow him to let you
know if it fits in well with the theme of the mud etc.  If he tells you he
likes your idea please remember that this is NOT a guarantee that it will be
accepted, that decision can only be made when you have a finished zone.

Anytime you email a god please remember that we all have lives, jobs, and
families.  Many times you will get a very quick response, other times it will
seem like it takes forever, just be patient.

Because there are many changes being made even as I write this, these docs will
soon be antiquated and need further updating.  I am sure there will also be typos
and mistakes, if you notice any go ahead and email me about them and I will make
certain to fix them in the next update.

**Special Note to Macintosh Users**
I have been contacted by several Mac users in the past week that have been
interested in writing areas.  Unless you have access to a Linux acct or a
DOS emulation program you will need to write your zones with a word-processor.
IF you do write an area, please contact me at xueqin@duris.mi.org BEFORE you
try to send it in.  There are problems with macs sending files to other 
computers that will require a few simple tricks to overcome.

                    II. FAQ ABOUT AREA MAKING ON DURIS MUD
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Many people have come forward with interest in making areas for
Duris, and this document was prepared to answer any questions you
might have about the process.  The entire task of area creation can be
summed up in one phrase:  "Area creation is not hard, just tedious --
it requires a lot of imagination."


Step 1 -  The Mechanics:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Area creation for Duris requires NO coding or programming knowledge
of ANY kind.  All it requires is patience and imagination.  All you
need to create an area is a standard word processor.

* Using a Standard Word Processor

This is a fine method of making a zone (although somewhat more
time-consuming than certain area editors out there, i.e. daed, dikued)
and many gods prefer this method.

Zone files are similar to the gamma Diku format, with the exception of
a lot of additions for Duris, and are simple text files.  Making a
zone with a word processor is akin to writing a book on the computer,
albeit with some added math and formatting.

* Using an Editor

One of our gods, Tavril, has coded an editor specifically for use with
DurisMUD. It is available by ftping to the Duris ftp site:
ftp duris.mi.org and is located in the /pub directory. The editor
is named DE is available for DOS and Linux.

Step 2 - Making the Zone:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Regardless of what method you use to make your area, there are many
formatting and stylistic rules you MUST follow when you are
making areas for Duris.  Below we have listed the most important (or
frequently asked about) tips on zone-making:

a) When making a room, you MUST indent 3 spaces in the beginning
of the room description.  Make sure you capitalize your room titles
appropriately, according to the accepted rules of grammar.

"Inside the Damp Cavern of Mushrooms"           - Acceptable.
"Inside the damp cavern of mushrooms"           - NOT acceptable.

In the previous example, the important descriptive words of the room
title should be capitalized.

b) Try to be grammatically correct with your zones.  Good
spelling is important, and how people view your work will reflect
either positively or negatively on the mud.  It's not something we
will get angry over, but people are quick to point out typos. Note
that if you use poor grammar, YOU will be expected to fix it.

c) Room descriptions that contain only one or two lines of text
are highly frowned upon.  A room description that consists of only one
sentence downgrades your zone and detracts from the overall effect it
will have on people.  A few of these are okay, but we will send back
any zone that is predominantly one- to two-line descriptions.  Two to
five sentences per room is desirable, depending on the level of detail
in any given room, with an average of around 4-5 lines/room for the
entire zone.

d) Many zone writers view making a zone as simply coming up with
ten different descriptions and duplicating them each 100 times.  This
is *not* acceptable on Duris.  However, in some cases, duplicate
room descriptions are fine, and even necessary in many instances.
Using the example of the vast Trackless Sea, it would have been sheer
madness to come up with 5,000 different room descriptions for the
ocean.  Also, in places that are *intended* to be repetitious such as
mazes or endless forests, duplicate room descriptions can be an
invaluable tool for confusing players.

As a general rule:  don't use many duplicate rooms unless there is a
good reason why they are repetitious.  However, we will not turn away
zones if you have some duplicates that are made out of laziness, but
repetition is frowned upon in practice and should be used with care.
If a zone contains more than 20% duplicate rooms, it is turned away
immediately.

e) Plot/Theme:  Every zone you make should be built around a plot
or a theme.  Zones that are made off-handedly, with "a little bit of
everything" thrown in, are often confusing and hard to fit into the
realism of the Duris interior world environment.  The only tip here
is that you should follow a theme for your zone.  For example, you
could create themes such as "The Kobold Village" or "The Underdark"
and make everything in your zone fit that theme as closely as
possible.  Taking your time and coming up with interesting and
intriguing little plots and twists within your zone can often make it
famous overnight.

f) Quality over quantity!  I cannot stress this point enough.
While many area makers judge themselves and other makers by how many
rooms they have made, this is actually not a good scale in practice
unless you are considering someone's zone as their application for
maker status or some such thing.  There are zones that are 400+ rooms 
that simply can’t compare to extraordinarily well-done 50 room zones.  
One of my favorite areas on a mud that died long ago was approximately
forty rooms....

g) Maps/Ideas:  It is always a good idea to talk first with a god
about your area to make sure it is acceptable for Duris.  Once this
is done, it is considered sound practice to make a graph-paper map of
your entire zone, outlining all your connect-points and details.  This
helps you get a good feel for the area and what you might be missing,
as well as ensuring it is geographically sound.  A map also helps in
mob placement and debugging, so it is a good thing to have handy.


The above are just a few of the more important and most frequently
misunderstood aspects of area creation on Duris.  There is also a
list of about 15 more such tips in the Duris docs below that you
*should* read if you are planning to make a zone for us.


Step 3 - What Kind of Zones Will Duris Accept?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
There are a few criteria that are a MUST for any zone going into
Duris.  These are non-negotiable terms:

a) The zone *must* be original.  We do not want to add any zone
into Duris that can be found on *any* other mud.  Soon all the stock
zones will be gone and we will be 100% original world.  To this end,
we require that any area you give to Duris not be found on other
muds as well.  We want people to be able to find Duris's zones only
on Duris.  If the zone is later found in several other muds, it
could be removed from Duris.  If you have zones that you wrote in the
past they will only be acceptable if they have NOT been installed on
any other muds.

b) The zone *must* be realistic to an AD&D world.  Duris does not 
follow the ‘Forgetten Realms’ theme, any AD&D type area is acceptable
so long as it fits into the general theme of the mud and is well-done. 

c) Note on zone syntax:  as stated in the past, you will receive a
MAKER status god for making a quality area.  The policy below is
important, as it is the portion that protects us, the Implementors of
Duris, as we use your area:

        "All people who donate and/or make an area for Duris and
        receive MAKER status for its incorporation into the mud are
        bound by the following:  you CANNOT at a later date demand
        that the zone be removed from the mud for ANY reason!  Once a
        zone is given to and becomes a part of Duris, it is
        permanently the property of Duris.  For example, if at a
        later date a MAKER is caught cheating and is demoted for it,
        the maker CANNOT in turn demand that Duris remove the zone
        in question."

Also, as a policy statement to protect you, the zone maker:

        "If you donate and/or make an area for Duris, and that area
        is used in the mud, only YOU, the area maker, have the right
        to govern what happens to that zone as far as distribution is
        concerned.  In other words, we, the Forgers of Duris, hereby
        guarantee that your area will NOT be given to ANYONE for any
        reason.  It will remain under tight lock and key at all times
        so that your hard work is not stolen and distributed all over
        the Internet.  To that end, we accept responsibility for the
        security of any zone donated to us."

These policies protect both the mud owners and the area makers
regarding the legality of using someone else's work, and clarify for
all our determination to make a 100% realistic world that can be found
no where else on the (virtual) globe.


Step 4 - Details! Details!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Here are some frequently asked questions about areas on Duris and
details regarding area creation:

Q: How do I determine experience points for my mobs?
A: Our mobile converter automatically assigns experience point values
depending on the mobs' level and characteristics. All you need do is
set the mob to the appropriate level, race, type, align and AFF/ACT
flags (detailed below). The converter will do the rest.

Q: What about equipment stats (weapon damages and such)?
A: As above, have some of our gods stat a few objects for you.  Not to
worry, if your object stats are off, we will help you adjust them once
the preliminary version of your zone is in for testing.  Additionally,
the docs below are slowly being given sections relating to object
standards and guidelines.  Following those guidelines will insure your
zone fits within Duris and will help reduce its playtest time.

Q: Will I receive a god for my area?
A: Yes. *IF* the area is well done and we use it, you will receive an
AVATAR status god (level 56).  This god is good for approximately three
months time per area you make.  Duris does NOT have ‘Admin’ gods, to keep
a ‘god’ further contributions of areas, code, etc. are required.  This 
keeps the mud fresh by making certain gods continue to work on improving
the mud.

Q: Can I choose where my area goes in the mud?
A: Partially.  We like to sit down with the area designers and have
them work with us on the best place for the zone's placement.  The
area designer does have first say as to where it will go, and 99% of
the time they are granted permission to put it in one of their
selected places.  At this time a wonderful new mapping system is in.
This system has increased the size of Duris many-fold, giving a huge 
variety of places to put new areas.  At this time there are several 
different continents, and we will be trying to divide areas somewhat 
roughly between the major continents.

These are a few of the basic questions that are often asked.  If you have
additional questions do not hesitate to ask a god when you see one on, or to
email one of us.  Please remember that just because a god is ‘on’ doesn’t mean
they can speak to you, give us time to reply.  Some gods (I am a culprit)
are ‘on’ but really afk as they work on other things in other windows and
might miss your petition.  When emailing gods please give us a reasonable 
amount of time to reply, we have lives too. --Xueqin

                   III. THE WORLD FILE (.WLD)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
The world file contains all the information for the rooms of a zone,
as well as partial information on exits and doors (see .zon file for
additional info on doors). The file is loaded once at boot time and is
called <zone name>.wld

Format of the world-file:
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
#<room number>
<name of room >~
<description>
~
<zone #> <room_flags> <sector_type>
<direction fields>
   <direction sub-fields (if direction exists)>
<extra description fields>
   <extra description sub-fields (if extra descriptions exist)>
<optional fields>
'S'

Note: Characters throughout these docs which are displated as 'char'
      mean use JUST the character in that spot, not to include the '.

Explanation of the World File Fields:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
#<room number>
   This is the number for the room. When scanning down the world file, no
   two rooms should have the same number and the numbers should increase
   down the file. Note, however, that the room numbers do NOT have to be
   sequential, just so long as the room numbers always increase from the
   beginning of the file towards the end there can be gaps in numbers.
   When you first create a room, start with XX000 and continue from there.
   That way, you can later search and replace the XX with whatever zone
   number an implementor assigns you once the zone has been accepted. You
   will note this same format for the other portions of an area.

<name of room>~
   This is the "title" of the room. Note that all room titles should be
   capitalized according to good English (ie. all major words except the,
   of, and etc.) See the example at the end of this section.

<description>
   This is the general description of the room.  At the end of the room
   desc, on the line immediately following the last line of text in the
   desc, put a ~ on the blank line.  The first line of the description
   should be indented three spaces.

<zone #>
   The number of the zone in which this room is located. This number is
   used for resetting zones and monster zone movement.  The number usually
   complements the room numbers, i.e. zone 40 would start with room numbers
   4000-4099. ** However, for your zone #, unless a imp/areas god has given
   you a specific number that you can use, use an unusual letter
   designation such as "aaa" or "ZZZ". Then, the imp can easily replace the
   zone # with the proper one later. (Actually you can go ahead and use
   whatever # you want, as long as the zone loads in the de we can renumber
   everything.)

<room_flags>
   A bit vector consisting of the room conditions.  Go through this list
   and decide which flags should affect that particular room.  Then add the
   values together and place the sum in for the room flag.

   DARK ------------------- 1 * Light must be used to see anything, note
                                 that rooms with this flag will ignore

                                 cover
   SINGLE_FILE           8192 * Where people can't go around each other in
                                 a room
   JAIL --------------- 16384 * This is a jail cell, used only in hometowns
   NO_TELEPORT          32768 * A random teleport spell will ignore these
                                 rooms
   PRIV_ZONE ---------- 65536 * DO NOT USE
   HEAL                131072 * Regeneration of hits/mana is much faster

                                 or from
   GUILD_ROOM -----  16777216 * For guild rooms only...
   TWILIGHT -------- 33554432 * Both evil and good races can see equally well
                                   -good flag to encourage race wars...

<sector_type>
   This determines how many movement points are used when moving through
   a location of the type - use one of the numbers 0-21 (they are NOT the
   movement-points used - merely indexes to a lookup-table):

   SECT_INSIDE ------------ 0 * Uses as if walking indoors
   SECT_CITY                1 * Uses as if walking in a city
   SECT_FIELD ------------- 2 * Uses as if walking in a field
   SECT_FOREST              3 * Uses as if walking in a forest
   SECT_HILLS ------------- 4 * Uses as if walking in hills
   SECT_MOUNTAIN            5 * Uses as if climbing in mountains
   SECT_WATER_SWIM -------- 6 * Uses as if swimming

   SECT_ARCTIC             25 * Arctic (cold, barren terrain)
   SECT_SWAMP              26 * Swampy terrain

<direction fields>
   Direction fields are used to provide information about the exits of a
   given room. All of the fields related to a direction only exist if that
   direction is defined for the room. Hence, if a room has no exits, there
   will be NO D<exit number>, <general description>, <keyword list>, <door
   flag>, <key number> or <to-room> information. Furthermore, if there is
   only a north exit, information will only be defined for that direction.

   ** Note about doors: You must make a door in both rooms that the door
                        is set between.


      <direction sub-fields>
       The sub-fields for the direction fields follow the following format:

          D<exit number>
          <exit description>
          ~
          <keyword list>~
          <door flag> <key number> <to-room>

      <exit number>
         Exit number defines the direction of the exit according to the
         following values:

          0 = North
          1 = East
          2 = South
          3 = West
          4 = Up
          5 = Down

      <exit description>
         This text will be what a players sees when they type 'look
         direction'. Follow the lines of text with a ~ on a line by
         itself (as shown in the format above).

      <keyword list>~
         This is a list of keywords for the "door" which will respond to
         commands like "open" and "close". Each word should be sperated
         by a space, and the end of the line should contain a '~' as shown.

      <door flag>
         This value determines the state of the "door", the basic values
         basic values (o,1,2, or3) are explained below:

         0 : no door or an open exit, this is the most common value
         1 : a closed door which can be opened/closed, and is not locked
         2 : a closed door which can be picked/opened/closed, and is locked
         3 : a closed door which cannot be picked, and is locked

       ** If a door is pickable it is also ‘door-bashable’, a door that can’t
          be picked can’t be bashed.

         If it is a secret door, then add the value 4 to it, this will
         cause the search command to be required before the door can be
         found.

         If it is a blocked exit, then add the value 8 to it.  A switch
         item will be needed to open the exit; ask a god for help if you
         wish to make blocked exits.

         The state of the doors after reset may be controlled by a command
         in the reset-command table (see the zone file). The initial state
         of a door is open.

      <key Number>
         This field can have several values:

         *The number of the object which can unlock/lock the door in the
          direction given. If a player carries/holds this object, they can
          unlock/lock the door.

         *If the key number value is 0, there is no key to the door.

         *If the key number value is -1, the door has no keyhole.

         *If the key number value is -2, the door requires a magic word to
          be said in order for it to open. This magic word will be the last
          value in the door names <keyword list>.

          If the <door flag> above is 0, the value of this field is ignored

      <to_room>
         The virtual number of the room to which the exit leads. If this
         number is -1 (NOWHERE), the exit doesn't lead anywhere. This might
         be useful for adding an exit-description in a direction which
         doesn't actually lead anywhere.

<extra description fields>
   Extra descriptions are used to provide additional information about a
   room if a person looks are certain things described in the room. If a
   room has no extra descriptions, the sub-fields detailed here are not
   included.

      <extra description sub-fields>
       The sub-fields for the extra description field follow the following
       format:

         'E'
         <extra description keyword list>~
         <description>
         ~

      E
      You must always put a capital E on a line by itself preceeding the 
      extra description.

      <extra description keyword list>~
         These are the words which will allow the extra description to be
         seen. The words the player will look at to see the description.
         These keywords must be seperated by blank spaces.

      <description>
         This is the description displayed when a player types 'look at
         <keyword>' which matches one of the words on the keyword list
         above. Follow the lines of text with a ~ on a line by itself
         (as shown in the format above).

NOTE: All the text fields above may be left blank, but the '~' should
      always be there.

<optional fields>
   These are all optional fields and do not need to appear in all rooms
   as they are for more specific circumstances.

   F
   <percentage>

    Chance of falling in the room - be careful, if there is a room below,
    damage will be calculated and the player may continue falling into
    lower rooms. If the original room has no down exit, it is a random-dt.
    (not yet implemented, but we could likely be prodded into it pretty
    easily) - this chance will be evaluated for each command entered - so
    low numbers (5-20%) would be a good average here, except for dangerous/
    tough rooms.

   C
   <current speed> <current direction>

    This option can be used to assign a current speed and direction to a
    ocean or river room. This will eventually affect boat travel and
    similar stuff. <current speed> can be between 0 and 100, while <current
    direction> uses the values 0-5 as per room exit directions. That table
    is reprinted below for convience.

          0 = North
          1 = East
          2 = South
          3 = West
          4 = Up
          5 = Down

            CREATION STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR THE WORLD FILE
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

   You must follow these guildlines if you plan on making a zone for Duris
   Creating areas can be a rather simple process. The primary element
   necessary is time to add together all the flags and compile the
   oodles of little elements to create the final whole.  Following these
   guidelines throughout your zone will improve its design, solve many
   errors, and make the creation of the zone go more smoothly. Furthermore,
   these guidelines often have purposes such as maintaining mud balance and
   playability which are essential in upkeeping Duris's quality.


   1)  Avoid the use of personal pronouns in descriptions. This implies
       that someone is there when this is not necessarily the case - the
       player reading the description will not necessarily even be in the
       room. This also extends to the idea of presenting actions in
       descriptions. If you fall into the room and land on your head in
       the room description, then you'll do that not only when you enter
       the room, but every time you look - this would not be good for
       anybody's head, I'm certain.

   2)  Indent room descriptions into paragraphs. Most of the indention's
       on the mud now are 3 spaces long. It would be nice to stick to this.
       Furthermore, all room descriptions should be around 4-7 lines long,
       this being ideal to both provide quality images of the zone while
       not being unduely spammy for the players walking in the room.

   3)  Areas don't have to be a series of encounters with monsters which
       are increasingly more dangerous until the grand finale has occurred.
       Players may be more interested in something that is not so straight-
       forward (though it should remain challenging). Basically, this is a
       plea for using creativity when designing an area, and isn't
       necessarily well-defined. Some areas may "work" very well with more
       ordinary approaches - the idea is to encourage the selection of the
       best possible treatment.

   4)  We are trying to make the mud "topologically sane" - so that
       there aren't any non-sensible overlapping of physical areas.
       Overlaps of three (or more) rooms in the same general area aren't
       helpful when connecting areas into a worldwide map, as we are now
       trying to do. It is also helpful not to have confusing directions
       in heavily frequented areas.

   5)  There is also one feature of Duris - single file rooms (see above)
       which requires "directional sanity" with the rooms that surrounds
       it, as it calculates which end of the room list to put people using
       the direction used to enter the room.

   6)  Use new features of Duris. There are a number of unique things
       in Duris, but people won't necessarily know if they aren't used.
       Read on for more specifics on what these are.

   7)  Give some warning to players as to what they may be encountering,
       and (hopefully in a creative way, so as not to be too blunt) give
       them a reasonable guess as to if they have a chance. By this, we do
       not mean tell them they have to be a group of 1 16th level cleric/
       warrior and 2 17th level warrior/thieves, but do give a general idea
       -- is it a good area for mid-level single classes, beginners, or
       high-level multies. While it is agreed that this is not necessarily
       the way real life works, it is a fact that it is more conducive to
       enjoyment of the game. We also recommend use of extra descriptions
       in rooms to warn of nearby danger. This encourages both players and
       area makers to put detail and thought into their exploration/
       creation.

   8)  A note on numbering: We prefer that you obtain vnums from a god to
       work with.  If not you can simply choose your own vnums and the 
       entire zone can be renumbered with Tavril’s de.

   9)  Avoid using the word YOU as much as possible in your world file.
       Why?  Because if someone casts Wizard Eye at a room, they are
       not actually there, just viewing from afar.  Using YOU a lot is just
       generally considered bad form, and reduced the quality of it's
       English. It isn't always avoidable, but should be used only in very
       rare instances (See #1 above)

   10) Perhaps the most important point. ALL areas must be realistic to
       a AD&D fantasy gaming environment. No silly zones like chess boards
       and the like on Duris, we are going for a realistic feel for this
       mud. ** Do not feel that this restricts you from being creative **
       You can make your own zones, as long as they fit the feel of Duris.
       The best thing to do is to email a detailed description of your
       proposed area to Tavril... tavril@duris.mi.org, he can tell you
       whether or not it fits in.

   11) Make sure that when you come up with an estimate on how many rooms
       that your zone will require, clear that number with an areas imp
       so that he will have an idea of what numbers you can use. Remember
       this: once you get a set of designated numbers for rooms, you have
       to work within those confines with objects and mobs. For example,
       if a imp says you may number your rooms from 100 to 300, all of
       your objects and mobs MUST be within those numbers. Thus, in the
       case where you have rooms from 100 to 300, if you have 300 objects,
       you would have to have more slots. Just ask the area god for more
       slots so that he knows you are vying for more room for your objects.

  *** Room numbers are not a problem, if you go over we can get you to 
      renumber your zone.  The mapping system has added the ability to 
      handle more than enough rooms for everyone...

   12) Make sure that you do not have any control characters in your files.
       (.wld, .mob, .obj, .zon, .shp or .qst) Some editors will do this,
       and there will be bugs if those control characters exist. I suggest
       using Word Perfect or Microsoft Word when you make a file. Then,
       when you save the file, save it as an "ascii standard" file or
       "ascii" file. This makes the file usable for Duris and eliminates
       any control characters. There are also editors available on the
       duris ftp site.

   13) Make sure that there are NO SPACES in between your directional
       vectors in the .wld file (this goes for the object, zone, and mob
       files also). For example:

       D1
       You see a tree.
       ~
       ~
       0 0 XX001
       D2
       You see a mountain.
       ~
       ~
       0 0 XX001

       The above is acceptable. This is not:

       D1
       You see a tree.
       ~
       ~
       0 0 XX001
             <----------space between direction vectors
       D2
       etc....

       Also, there should NEVER be spaces AFTER tildes (~). That will
       also create problems.

   14) Make sure that you put the EXTRA tilde in your direction vector
       setup. Example:

       D1
       You see trees.
       ~   <----  this tilde is to end the description "You see trees."
       ~   <----  this EXTRA tilde is here because there is no door
       0 0 XX001  to the room going east; thus, there is no key word
                  needed for a door, so we just put a tilde here.

   15) Rooms which are flagged as NO_GROUND must have down exits. The reason
       for this is the necessity for fly/levitate in NO_GROUND rooms and
       the falling which results otherwise, thus the down is needed as a place
       to fall to.

   16) Rooms which are flagged SINGLE_FILE should have exactly two exits.
       Otherwise, the rooms will not be flagged SINGLE_FILE, because the
       order of people in the room could not be determined.

   17) Make sure that if you are doing a cave and make the room lit with
       light, put a description in the room saying there is a torch or
       something providing a light. This would make more sense in a dark
       tunnel or cave. Otherwise, make it dark with the DARK flag.

   18) Make sure that if you DO NOT want certain mobs roaming around in
       other parts of your zone, that you use the NO_MOB flag. Put the
       NO_MOB flag where you would cut off the roaming mobs from
       attempting to leave. It is probably not a good idea to later load
       a mob into that room if it is a NO_MOB room. Note that a HUNTER
       mob, which is hunting, will ignore a NO_MOB room to track its
       victim.

   19) Don't forget to use the INDOORS flag when it is appropriate, or
       you will be getting outside weather in small huts-- that is not
       realistic.

   20) Use the sector number for CITY travelling when there is a pathway
       or stone pathway through an area-- even if that area is not a city.
       The pathway acts just as a pathway would in a city. However, if the
       person is walking through some dense foliage, or climging mountains
       or walking up hills, use the appropriate flag.

                     AN EXAMPLE WORLD FILE WITH COMMENTS
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
This section gives examples of a couple of  rooms of a world file. The
rooms were made to especially display the formats for ~'s, captialization,
exits, doors, and extra descriptions.

#XX1
The First Room of Chaos~
   This room contains several exits, in fact one leading in every possible
direction. Each of these exits has different characteristics to be noted
regarding the various settings of door states, exit directions, keyword
lists, magic doors and such. There are also two objects mentioned in the
room which can be viewed as extra descriptions. First of all, there is a
ceramic vase and then there is the wooden desk which the vase sits upon.
~
XX1 4104 0
D0
This exit leads north to room two. There is no door in this direction..
it is an open exit.
~
~
0 0 XX2
D1
This exit leads east to room three. It has closed door with the keywords
wooden and door.
~
door wooden~
1 0 XX3
D2
This exit leads south to room four. It has a closed and locked door with
the keywords gate and iron.
~
gate iron~
2 0 XX4
D3
This exit leads west to room five. It has an unpickable locked door with
the keywords portal and metal.
~
portal metal~
3 0 XX5
D4
This exit leads up to room six. It has a magic trapdoor which responds
to the word duris and can be opened using door or trapdoor.
~
trapdoor door duris~
3 -2 XX6
D5
This exit leads down to room seven. An unpickable locked door blocks the
way but can be opened if you have the key with virtual number 999.
~
door~
3 999 XX7
E
vase ceramic~
This is a ceramic vase which has been painted with bright green and blue
floral patterns.
~
E
desk wooden~
This wooden desk appears to be quite rustic and well travelled. Scuff
marks and water stains mar its varnished suffer and tell tales of its age.
Several drawers line the right hand side of the desk and a padded swivel
chair rest beneath it. The rool top portion of the desk is littered in
copies of the duris area docs, scratch paper, hastily drawn maps and pages
discussing the characteristics of various nasty fiends and monsters.
~

#XX10
The Tenth Room of Chaos~
   This room is filled with the vacuous eddies of chaos. Intelligent
observers will note that the first room was number one and this room is
number ten. that is fine so far as no rooms are out of sequence. I could
skip around all day on room numbers, but I have to keep them within my
zone range (once an implementor has assigned those values) and arranged
from lowest number to highest number within the file. Otherwise though,
this room is very boring. It shows what a room with no exits and no extra
descriptions would look like.

Facts About the Rooms:
----------------------
Room Number:
In these examples the room numbers and zone numbers have been prefaced 
with ‘XX’.  This allows an easy search/replace to renumber the zone.
Only use this method if you are going to use a word processor to write your
zone and are unable to use the de.  We can give you vnums to work with, or
simply renumber your zone with Tavril’s de if we need to.  One point I would
like to make, using the de is the EASIEST way to make certain all your flags
are set properly and that all the tildes and tiny details have been inserted
properly.  If you want to write room, mob, obj descriptions with a word-
processor please do, then run the files through the de to set the appropriate
flags and to load mobs and objects to create the .zon file.

Zone Number: 1
Room Flags: INDOORS and NO_PRECIP (8 + 4096 = 4104)
Sector Type: Inside (this is for movement calculation only)

IV. THE MONSTER FILE (.MOB)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Mobiles are stored in the .mob file. Loads of these monsters occurs once at
MUD boot time and again everytime the zone resets (repops), which is
information stored in the ZONE FILE discussed later in these docs. The mob
file is named <zone name>.mob.

Format of the mob-file:
- - - - - - - - - - - -
#<virtual number>
<namelist>~
<short description>~
<long description>
~
<description>
~
<action flags> <affect1 flags> <affect2 flags> <alignment> S
<species> <hometown> <Class>
<Level> <Thac0> <AC> <Hit Points (format is xdy+z)> <Damage (as HP)>
<Gold> <Exp>
<position> <default position> <sex>

Explanation of the Mob File Fields:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
#<virtual number>
   This is the monster's vertual number. You should use values from XX00-
   XX<higest mob number> unless otherwise instructed by an Implementor.
   Other rules are the same as those for the world file room numbers.

<namelist>
   The space-separated name alias list. Use the most "proper" name for the
   mob as the first name in the keyword list. This proper name is the one
   used in the display prompt for enemy and other important locations. It
   looks much better to see yourself fighting a dragon, than fighting a
   gold, if your opponent were a gold dragon for, instance.

   NOTES:
   If the mob is flagged AGG of any type (agg, agg_evil, etc.), you may
   optionally add agg_n or agg_d to its keywords. This will make the mob
   aggro ONLY during night/day respectively.

   If a mob if flagged as a dragon, it may be given specific breath weapons
   using the keywords: br_f, br_g, br_c, br_l, and br_a (fire, gas, cold,
   lightning, and acid). If this is not done, the mob will breath a random
   type of breath weapon with each attack. These should be the LAST
   keywords in the namelist.

<short description>
   This string will be displayed when the monster take action, for example
   if it is "the powerful cityguard", and the cityguard leaves south the
   message will be "the powerful cityguard leaves south." This is also the
   string displayed during combat

<long description>
   This description is displayed when the monster is in it's "default"
   position. When not in the default position, a message like:
   "<short description> is sleeping here." could be displayed.

<description>
   This will be displayed when a player looks at the monster.

    +349  .. -349   Neutral Alignment
    -350  .. -1000  Evil Alignment

<Level>
   Just try to be appropriate for your zone, ie a lvl 40 aggro dragon in a 
   lvl 10-20 zone is a bit insane.

<THAC0>***
   The monsters THAC0.
   THAC0 is an abbreviation for "To Hit Armor Class Zero".

<AC>***
   The monsters armor class.  use 10 to -10

<Hit Points (format is xdy+z)>*** 
   This defines the number of hitpoints a given monster has. If this is
   entered into the file:

    ... ... 3d8+10 ...

   the monster will have 10 hitpoints plus the result of rolling 3 dice
   with 8 side, and adding their sum. All the numbers (even zero), the
   plus sign, and the letter 'd' MUST be entered!!! Example:

   ..... 1d6+0 ....

<Damage Roll (format is xdy+z)>***
   (the Bare hand damage). The format is exactly like the one described
   for hit points. A thing to note about damage:
   The number after the plus sign, is the "strength bonus". This bonus
   will apply to any weapons used, and bare hands too. Example:

   ..... 1d4+10

   This monster will damage between 11 and 14 hitpoints each round. If the
   monster picks up and wields a tiny stick which give 1d2 damage, then the
   monster will now damage by : 1d2 + 10 points.

<Gold>***
   The amount of gold carried by the monster.

<Exp>***
   The experience this monster has.

   These are all the mob races currently available on Duris, eventually to be
   expanded further. Underneath the mob races, in parentheses, are the traits
   which that mob race will automatically receive. Please take these into
   account when you design a monster.  Mob races will have more ‘traits’ and
   abilities added to them in the future.  Note that in special instances you
   can alter certain characteristics or abilities through the addition of an 
   ‘identifier’ as the FINAL keyword in the keyword list.

            CREATION STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR THE MOB FILE
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
   You must follow these guildlines if you plan on making a zone for Duris
   Creating areas can be a rather simple process. The primary element
   necessary is time to add together all the flags and compile the
   oodles of little elements to create the final whole.  Following these
   guidelines throughout your zone will improve its design, solve many
   errors, and make the creation of the zone go more smoothly. Furthermore,
   these guidelines often have purposes such as maintaining mud balance and
   playability which are essential in upkeeping Duris's quality.

   1)  Short mob descriptions should begin with "the" definite article (the
       Menacing Bureaucrat, the bone-white skeleton). Exceptions, as well,
       would be for certain mobs that are unique (Biff Stud, Miko) and can
       be considered 'proper nouns'. This is somewhat contradictory with
       the "rule" for items, but the way messages are set up and with the
       current contents of those files, this seems the best way to go.

   2)  For mobs, do *not* capitalize anything in the name list. Also, do not
       capitalize the definite pronoun (if used). Obviously, if it is a proper
       noun (such as Biff, Miko), it should be capitalized. These same rules
       apply for objects. Do not capitalize anything in the name list, and do
       not capitalize the indefinite pronoun. Capitalize the short only if it
       is a proper noun such as 'Sting'for a "named weapon"....

   3)  Areas don't have to be a series of encounters with monsters which
       are increasingly more dangerous until the grand finale has occurred.
       Players may be more interested in something that is not so straight-
       forward (though it should remain challenging). Basically, this is a
       plea for using creativity when designing an area, and isn't necessarily
       well-defined. Some areas may "work" very well with more ordinary
       approaches - the idea is to encourage the selection of the best
       possible treatment.

   4)  Mobs should not be loaded with default positions of swimming, flying or
       levitating. Instead, they should be given AFF_FLY, AFF_LEVITATE,
       CAN_SWIM, CAN_FLY, CAN_LEVITATE.

   5)  Take advantage of the many new and different flags used by Duris.  
       These flags will allow you to take advantage of the code that many
       People have worked so hard on.

                      AN EXAMPLE MOB ENTRY WITH COMMENTS
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Example of a Sample Mob :

#16400
kenku mad~
&+ya mad kenku&N~
&+yA mad kenku dances through the courtyard making warbling sounds.&N
~
This is an example of a mob that was taken directly from a recently 
installed area.
~
1073875052 188219408 0 -400 S
H 0 13
30 0 0 1d1+1 1d1+1
0.0.0.0 0
8 8 1

Explanation of the example :

The first row is a list of all the keywords someone can use when attacking,
socializing with a mob.  The second is the Short Name, used in many places,
battle for one, in which you would see, Johnny hits a mad kenku very hard.
The third is the Long Name, which is what you see when you walk in a room with
the mob in it.  The fourth is the mob desc.

His ACT flag is 1073875052, which are the following flags added together:
ACT_SCAVENGER
ACT_ISNPC
ACT_AGGRESSIVE
ACT_STAY_ZONE
ACT_MEMORY
ACT_CANFLY
ACT_HUNTER

His AFFECT1 flag is 188219408, which is a combination of the following flags:
AFF_HASTE
AFF_SNEAK
AFF_HIDE
AFF_FEARLESS
AFF_BARKSKIN
AFF_INFRAVISION
AFF_FLY

His AFFECT2 flag is 0 (no flags)

The fourth number is -400, which is his alignment (Somewhat evil)

The capital S is always there, in every mob, its just an internal flag

The next line is H (Humanoid), 0 for Hometown (None) 

The final value is 13, which is his class (thief)

The next line: He is level 30, THAC0* - 0 (Hitroll), 0 for AC*,
               Hitpoints* are 1d1+1, and Damage* rolls of 1d1+1
               *these are set by the mob converter later on, use these
               defaults for your mobs.

The next line is 0.0.0.0, which is how much money he has, and 0, for his
Experience. Again, these fields will be set by a mob converter, keep them 
all at a standard default like this.

The final line is 8 8 1, Meaning he is standing normally, standing after
attacked, and is a male (1)

                         V. THE OBJECT FILE (.OBJ)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Objects are stored in the .obj file. Loads of these objects occurs once at
MUD boot time, then repops will load additional objects dependant on various
parameters discussed in the ZONE FILE such as max numbers of objects and the
percentage load of those items.

Format of the Object File:
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
#<virtual number>
<namelist>~
<short description>~
<long description>~
~
<type flag> <extra flag> <wear flag>
<value 0> <value 1> <value 2> <value 3>
<weight> <value> <condition> <saff1> <saff2>
<extra description fields>
[Trap fields- if used]
<object affect fields>
   <object affect sub-fields (if affect exists)>
'$~'

Explanation of the Object File Fields:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
#<virtual number>
   See rules for rooms and mobs above.

<namelist>~
   Same as for monsters, these are the words use when handling the item,
   for taking or grabbing it. Note that the first word in this list should
   be the most "proper" keyword for the item, as it is shown when you sell
   the item, etc. An example would be a fine leather cloak with keywords:
   cloak leather fine in that order. It is also desirable for you to use
   material types as keywords.

   Special note for liquid containers: When using keywords for ITEM_DRINKCON
   objects, be sure to use the liquid type as the first keyword. This is
   because when a liquid container is emptied, it removes the first liquid
   keyword, later replacing it by the next liquid type it is filled with.
   Thus, a waterskin should have keywords: water waterskin skin, for example.
   Then, if the skin were emptied and later filled with milk, its keywords
   would become: milk waterskin skin.

<short description>~
   This string will be displayed when the object is used. For example
   if it is "a rubber raft", and a player drops it, then a message like:
   "Monthly drops a rubber raft."
   could be displayed.

<long description>~
   This description is displayed when the object is lying on the ground.
   For example, if it is "A furled umbrella lies here.~" then this message
   is displayed when the umbrella is lying on the ground. Since the endings
   for long descriptions have tended to be rather monotonous, the following
   is a varied list of suggested endings:

   Examples: Such and such lies here, lies here discarded, lies discarded
   here, has been laid aside here, has been cast aside here, rests here, has
   been dumped here, has been thrown away here, lies abandoned here, etc.
   You should generally avoid using on the ground, on the road or other such
   specific terrains as it'd look funny if the object were dropped on the
   Elemental Plane of Fire, for example.

<value 0> <value 1> <value 2> <value 3>
   These values are very central. They define the ability of items based on
   the items <item type>. These values are defined below and differ for each
   type of item. Note that if you define an item as being anything but a
   weapon, you shouldn't set the 'wield' flag. Many similar obvious rules
   apply.

   <contents> indicates that the contents MUST be entered.

   [contents] indicates that the contents can OPTIONALLY be entered.

          The above values for drunkenness/fullness/thirst are used per
          four "units" drunk. The values are expressed in HOURS!
          Example:
            Dragon empties a bottle (say 7 units) of saltwater.
            His Drunkenness is not changed ((7/4)*0)
            His Fullness increases by ((7/4)*1) hours
            His Thirst increases by ((7/4)*-2) hours, thus making
               him More thirsty.

          The hours above are numbers between 0 and 24. 24 hours is
          maximum for drunkenness/fullness/thirst. When hours are zero
          for any drunkenness/fullness/thirst the person will be
          sober, hungry, or thirsty respectively.

    Value[3]: if this value is non-zero, then the drink is poisoned.

         There are a number of different poisons that can be used, when
      using these poisons remember that poisons in liquid containers can
      be applied to daggers etc by assassins.  This means that the strong
      poisons should actually be quite difficult to get.

<extra description fields>
   Extra descriptions are used to provide additional information about an
   object if a person looks at the object. Note that these are a required
   field for objects. Use this place to describe the object, hint at its
   uses/abilities, rationalize the object's existance, etc.

      <extra description sub-fields>
       The sub-fields for the extra description field follow the following
       format:

         'E'
         <extra description keyword list>~
         <description>
         ~

      E
      You must always put a capital E preceeding the extra description.

      <extra description keyword list>~
         These are the words which will allow the extra description to be
         seen. The words the player will look at to see the object's
         description. These keywords must be seperated by blank spaces.

      <description>
         This is the description displayed when a player types 'look at
         <keyword>' which matches one of the words on the keyword list
         above. Follow the lines of text with a ~ on a line by itself
         (as shown in the format above).

*************************************************************************
[Trap Fields] 
   Yes, there is code now that allows you to create ‘traps’ and/or trapped
   items.  NO_SHOW traps can also be triggered by PC’s. This 
   information is ONLY inserted if an item is going to be a ‘trap’
         ‘T’
         <trap triggers> <Damage type> <#charges> <level of trap>
   T
   The ‘T’ lets the program know that it is a trap, this is required for trapped
   items.

   <Trap Triggers>
   This is another bitmask that sets the triggers and area the trap effects:
                1 - Triggers on Movement
                2 - Triggers on get/put
                4 - Affects all in the room

              256 - Affects all who leave the room DOWN
              512 - Triggers on being opened
   These values are additive, ie. 516--Triggers on being opened affects all in
   the room.

   <Damage Type>
   This sets the ‘type’ of damage the trap deals out...
                0 - Sleep
                1 - Teleport (Random Teleport)
                2 - Fire

                7 - Piercing
                8 - Slashing
 
   <Charges>
   This sets the number of charges in the trap, -1 is infinite.

   <Trap Level>
   This sets the level of the trap for the purpose of calculating damage.
   Trap levels can be 1-100.
*************************************************************************

<object affect fields>
   Between zero and two "affect's" may be set on an item. The affects could
   for example modify a characters strength, height etc. The affect only goes
   into affect when the character wear, wield or hold the item. The affect
   is removed when the character removes the items. If an affect is desired
   for an object, the following sub-fields may be inserted into the object's
   format:

      'A'
      <location> <modifier>
      'A'
      <location> <modifier>

         'A'
          When items are worn using wear/wield/grab/hold commands, the 'A' will
          allow the items to affect a characters various abilities. Currently
          a maximum of 2 'A' are allowed.

          <location>
           <location> is one of the below numbers, indicating which ability
           will be changed.

           APPLY_NONE       0 * DO NOT USE.

           APPLY_SV_BREATH 23 *
           APPLY_SV_SPELL  24 * This is the most used saving throw.

           APPLY_CHARISMA  28 *
           APPLY_KARMA     29 * Luck and karma are not see on the player's
           APPLY_LUCK      30 * stats, but the object will show these to
                                be modified.
           <modifier>
            The modifier is added to the APPLY_XXX ability of the character
            when he uses an item, and is subtracted when he stops using it.
            Take great care when using this. This is an example of an item of
            improve strength and armor class. Example:

               A
               1 2
               A
               17 -2

            This adds +2 to the strength, and adds -2 to the AC (thus improving
            it). No more 'Affects’ are allowed at this time.

            CREATION STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR THE OBJECT FILE
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
   You must follow these guildlines if you plan on making a zone for Duris.
   Creating areas can be a rather simple process. The primary element
   necessary is time to add together all the flags and compile the
   oodles of little elements to create the final whole.  Following these
   guidelines throughout your zone will improve its design, solve many
   errors, and make the creation of the zone go more smoothly. Furthermore,
   these guidelines often have purposes such as maintaining mud balance and
   playability which are essential in upkeeping Duris's quality.

   1)  Short item descriptions should begin with an indefinite article (a
       blue cape, some stretch pants). Reasonable exceptions will usually
       be for items which should be unique (The Balor's whip, Sting).
       In these cases, it would be best to call them, a dagger named, 'Sting'

   2)  Use new features of Duris. There are a number of unique things
       in Duris, but people won't necessarily know if they aren't used.
       Read on for more specifics on what these are.

   3)  A note on numbering: If you don’t get vnums from a god we will still
       be able to renumber your entire zone with the de.  It is easiest for
       us if you get vnums from a god first though, it saves us the time of
       changing them.

    4) Be careful about making items which are too powerful. Items should
       make sense in relation to the place/mob where they are found (in other
       words, items do not exist purely to satisfy the needs of players), and
       have power commensurate to the difficulty in obtaining it. It is also
       suggested that most magic or otherwise powerful items have downsides
       in order to even things out - a sword which can hit for a lot of damage
       might be too heavy to carry much else, or lower constitution by a point
       or two. (An amendment to this, showing relative strength of items and
       mobs is on a list of possible additions to this document). Additional,
       more specific, object guidelines are to be found below.

    5) Do not use dice with 100 sides or more - it's hard to tell just
       which side is on top when we roll them. Also, no one- or zero-sided
       dice - they just don't seem to make those anymore.

    6) All objects should have extra descriptions. Extra descriptions are
       generally a quick thing to add and they end up providing a great deal
       of flavor for the MUD. The use of extra descriptions can be used to
       hint at a zone's theme, describe strange properties of the item, and
       explain more what the area creator invisioned with the item.

    7) Container guidelines:
       Consider the following typical values and rules for any containers
       you make.

          Typical Containers:
          -------------------
          a typical small bag/sack holds around 30 lbs
          a typical large bag/sack holds around 50 lbs
          a typical small backpack holds around 75 lbs
          a typical large backpack holds around 120 lbs
          a typical small belt pouch holds around 15 lbs
          a typical large belt pouch holds around 25 lbs
          *See the standard object list at the end of the docs for more
           examples.

          Magical Containers:
          -------------------
          Magical versions of containers can have higher maxhold values,
          so long as the object makes sense and is suitablly difficult to
          obtain. The problem arises when objects are given negative
          values for weight, in order to simulate bags of holding and
          such. Follow a couple of simple rules here and remember than
          any abnormal containers should be very rare in order to keep them
          a special feature of the game.

          *the negative value of weight should never be larger than the
          mxhold, although they can be equal

          *pouches, belts, and other "small" items should not exceed
          -100 lbs in weight, larger items such as bags, backpacks,
          robes, etc should not exceed -300 lbs in weight

    8) Weapon Guidelines:

        Typical Common Weapons: Your typical weapons will range in damage
        dice from 1d4 (daggers), 1d6 (maces/staves/short swords), 1d8 (long
        swords, battle axes) to 1d10 (pole arms). Common two-handed weapons,
        will be about double these values. Inferior weapons can be slightly
        lower in dice and better quality weapons could be like a 2d2 dagger.

        High Quality Weapons: Higher quality weapons can have maximum damages
        up to the limits listed below:

          Max     Weapon style
          ---     ------------
          6       Daggers, darts, staves
          8       Clubs, fighting staves
          10      Short Swords, MorningStars
          12      Long Swords, general polearms
          20      Hand-and-a-Half swords (Single handed weapons which cannot be
                                          Dual wielded)
          32      Two-Handed swords

        Weapon Minuses/Plues on To-Hit and Damage: Items which have modifiers
        to their to-hit roll or damage, in general should be flagged MAGIC or
        BLESS or have some hint in their extra description which clarifies
        the objects powers. Minuses/Pluses will vary between one and five.
        Note that inferior weapons will generally not have modifiers, but
        rather poor dice for damage (like a 1d2 dagger).

    9) Object Value Guidelines and Examples:

        Monetary values for treasure and equipment have general guidelines
        which should be followed. The chart below lists some relative "wealth
        categories" from poor to extraordinarily rich. When assigning a value
        for an object, base your choice on the examples given below. Using them
        as best approximations to the value your object should have. Note that
        all values are given in COPPER pieces, with 1pcoin(PP) = 10gcoin(GP) =
        100scoin(SP) = 1000ccoin(CP) Obviously, there is a great deal of
        fluxtuation in object quality, presentation, location, etc. which will
        vary object value.

        Category One - Poor Wealth:
        - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

        (400,000CP+)

   10) Number of Items:

        In general, only the most powerful of mobs should have more than two
        or three items on them (notable exception is shopkeepers). Mobs,
        cannot carry full sets of equipment and maintain a mud balance, thus
        that aspect of realism cannot be allowed.

   11) To-hit and Damage Equipment, Other Stat Equipment:

        Non-weapon equipment which affects damage or to-hit rolls should be
        typically ONLY +1 or +2 maximum. Equpment which affects saves should
        be limited to +1 or +2, while stat eq should not exceed +8.

   12) Ac Notes:

        Items worn on fingers or ears ignore ac-apply. Held items and items
        worn on the eyes should not be given ac-apply. Think of ac-apply as
        indicative of material properties of the item (size, weight, structure,
        material type, etc.) while affects ac shows any magical properties
        of the item. Some guideline max values are given below, based on both
        armor make and how much body area it covers:

Example item for reference :

#XX00
sword long~
a long sword~
A long sword lies here.~
~
5 0 8193
0 1 6 3
10 350 1

Explanation of the example :

#XX00 is used for the item numbers, number them XX00, XX01, etc.

sword long~ is the key list, the words used when "wielding", "taking" the item.

a long sword~ is the Short Name, what you see in your inv or when wearing the
  item.

A long sword lies here. is the Long Name, used when the item is on the ground.

~   <---- Must ALWAYS be there, its an internal flag.

5 0 8193 <-- 5 is ITEM_TYPE weapon, 0 is the <extra flag> (In this case none
             are used), and 8193 is ITEM_TAKE (1) added with ITEM_WEAPON (8192)

0 1 6 3 is the Values line, which is unique for every Item Type, a long list
        of what these values are for each item type is at the end of this doc.
        in this case, 0 is not used (Value 0), 1 and 6 mean the sword does 1d6
        damage (Values 1-2), and 3 is item "slashes" (Value 3)

Example of a trapped desk:
#1000

0 0 100
E
desk~
This is a trapped desk that will put out a fireball when it is finally opened.
~
T
516 2 1 35

Explanations:
15 0 0 ->The item is a container (15), extra flag is (0) and it can’t be taken or   
         worn (0)

50 13 0 0 -> The container can hold (50) pounds and it is closable, closed and
             locked (13).  There is no key (0) and the final value is (0).

0 0 100 -> The desk is weightless (0), valueless (0) and in perfect condition
           (100). [Due to the above flags it can’t be picked up and carried
           away, let alone sold]

skipping extra description fields...

T -> lets the game know this obj has a trap

516 2 1 35 -> This trap will affect everyone in the room when it is opened 
              (516=512+4), it will do ‘FIRE’ damage (2), it has one charge
              (1), and it is level 35 (35).

<command>
'S'

Explanation of the Zone File Fields:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
#<virtual number>
   This is the zone vnum, use XX unless an Implementor assigns you a
   number value.

<name>~
   This is the name of the zone.

<top of zone>
   This is the top room of the zone, the highest number room in your zone.

<life span>
   This value is the life span of the zone and tells the game when to reset
   or repop the zone. The life span is a value in real minutes. When the
   age of the zone, since last reset, reaches this value the zone is queued
   for reset. Then the zone is reset ass soon as posible, depending on the
   conditions of the zone reset mode below.

<reset mode>
   The reset mode determines the conditions which will allow the zone to
   reset or repop once its life span has expired. This may take on one of
   three values:

      0: Never reset the zone, regardless of life span. In this case, the
         age of the zone is never queued for rest, thus the value for life
         span is effectively ignored.

      1: This value will reset the zone as soon as there are no players left
         in any of its rooms. Also called no pc repop by some.

     2: Reset the zone immediately no matter who are what is in it.

   Note the significance of the zone life span and reset mode, especially
   with difficult zones repopping alot (just killed the dragon and resting?
   here have another one 5 second later) or newbie zones repoping too slow
   for people to want to spent time there. Typical values are 10-20 minute
   life spans for cities and newbie areas and 30-40 mins for high level zones,
   with low level zones reset mode 2 and high level zones reset mode 1 or
   possiblly 0 (rarely used).

<flag1>
   This flag can define the following features for the zone, which can be
   added together:

      ZONE_SILENT    1
      ZONE_SAFE      2
      ZONE_HOMETOWN  4

<season patterns>
   There are several season patterns available which designate how the year's
   seasons are divided in the region of the zone. You can choose from the
   following:

      ONE_SEASON                1    <------------1------------>
      TWO_SEASONS_EQUAL         2    <-----1------><-----2----->
      TWO_SEASONS_FIRST_LONG    3    <-------1-------><---2---->
      TWO_SEASONS_SECOND_LONG   4    <---1----><------2-------->
      THREE_SEASONS_EQUAL       5    <---1---><---2---><---3--->
      FOUR_SEASONS_EQUAL        6    <--1--><--2--><--3--><--4-->
      FOUR_SEASONS_EVEN_LONG    7    <-1-><---2---><-3-><---4--->
      FOUR_SEASONS_ODD_LONG     8    <---1---><-2-><---3---><-4->

   Note that the numbers in the right hand diagram refer to the columns in the
   weather tables explained below. For example, if your zone has two seasons,
   equally long, values for wind3, wind4, precip3, precip4 etc. will all be
   0, as that "season" does not exist. See weather table information below.

<flag2>
   This flag can define the following features for the zone, which can be
   added together:

      NO_MOON_EVER        1
      NO_SUN_EVER         2
      NON_CONTROLLABLE    4  *Weather can't be controlled by spells in the zone
      WHOLE_ZONE_INDOORS  8

<mana_add>
   The amount of mana regenerated in the zone, currently this has no meaning
   and is outdated DIKU information. In the future, it may have use with
   psionics...leave it 0 until told otherwise.


<weather table - wind>
   This line has four values, one for each of a posible four seasons:

   wind1 wind2 wind3 wind4

   Each of these four values should be filled in from the following table:

   Seasonal Wind Characteristics:
   ------------------------------
      SEASON_NON-EXISTANT  0
      SEASON_CALM          1
      SEASON_BREEZY        2
      SEASON_UNSETTLED     3
      SEASON_WINDY         4
      SEASON_CHINOOK       5
      SEASON_VIOLENT       6
      SEASON_HURRICANE     7

<weather table - wind variance>
   This line has four values, one for each of a possible four seasons:

   windvar1 windvar2 windvar3 windvar4

   Each of these four values should be filled in from the following table:

   Seasonal Wind Variations:
   -------------------------
      WIND CAN CHANGE DIRECTION      0
      WIND CAN NOT CHANGE DIRECTION  1

   This value won't matter if the season does not exist, so just use 0 for
   any unused seasons in the table.

<weather table - wind direction>
   This line has four values, one for each of a possible four seasons:

   winddir1 winddir2 winddir3 winddir4

   Each of these four values should be filled from the following table:

   Seasonal Wind Directions (At Start of Season):
   ----------------------------------------------
      NORTH   0
      EAST    1
      SOUTH   2
      WEST    3

   This value won't matter if the season does not exist, so just use 0 for
   any unused seasons in the table.

<weather table - precipitation>
   This line has four values, one for each of a possible four seasons:

   precip1 precip2 precip3 precip4

   Each of these four values should be filled using the following table:

   Seasonal Precipitation Characteristics:
   ---------------------------------------
      SEASON_NON-EXISTANT    0
      SEASON_NO_PRECIP_EVER  1
      SEASON_ARID            2

<command table>
   The following begins a command table, a series of commands to execute at
   mud boot and zone resets. The end of the table is terminated with a S and
   can contain multiple commands, one to a line, which can be repeated.

   Each command possibility consists of a letter, identifying the command
   type, followed by three or four arguements. The first argument, common to
   all the commands is called the <if-flag>, which can have a value of 0 or 1.
   if the value is 0, the command is always executed when called for. If the
   value is 1, the command is ONLY executed if the previous command was
   executed. Other information is contained with each command as shown below:

      M (TO Load a Mobile)
      --------------------
      Format: 'M' <if-flag> <mobile vnum> <max existing> <room vnum>

      This command loads a mobile in a room.

      <mobile vnum>  : The vnum of the mob to be loaded
      <max existing> : This specifies the maximum number of the mob which
                       can exist in the mud at one time. If the max number is
                       about to be exceeded, the command won't be executed.
                       If you only want one manifestation of a given monster,
                       just use the number 1.
      <room vnum>    : The vnum of the room that the mob is to be loaded into.

      F (TO Load a Mobile that Follows Another Mobile)
      ------------------------------------------------
      Format ‘F’ <if-flag> <mobile vnum> <max existing> <room vnum>

      This command loads a mobile that follows the previously loaded mobile 
      that has been loaded with an ‘M’ command.  An example is:
      M 0 16083 1 16143        * the brutal overseer
      F 1 16082 2 16143        * the slave guard (following)
      F 1 16084 2 16143        * an enslaved duergar miner (following)
      Both of the above mobs are following the overseer. Objects given
      or equipped on the above mobs still occur immediately after the
      mob entry.  Remember that fol. mobs and their leaders MUST be
      loaded into the same room.

      O (TO Load an Object)
      ---------------------
      Format: 'O' <if-flag> <object vnum> <max existing> <room vnum>

      This command loads an object in a room. Note that most eq needs to be
      on a mob or in a non-takable container in order to prevent people from
      snatching the equipment up without having to kill the guardian etc.
      Obviously, there are exceptions but this is a zone makign tip.

      <object vnum>  : The vnum of the object to be loaded.
      <max existing> : This specifies the maximum number of the object which
                       can exist in the mud at one time.
      <room vnum>    : The vnum of the room that the object is to be loaded
                       into.

      G (TO Give an Object to a Mobile)
      ----------------------------------
      Format: 'G' <if-flag> <object vnum> <max existing>

      This command gives an object to the last monster referenced, that is,
      the last M command previous to this command in the command table. The
      object will then "load" in the monster's inventory.

      <object vnum>  : The vnum of the object to be loaded.
      <max existing> : This specifies the maximum number of the object which
                       can exist in the mud at one time.

      E (TO Equip a Mobile With an Object)
      ------------------------------------
      Format: 'E' <if-flag> <object vnum> <max existing> <equipment position>

      This command loads an object and places it in the worn equipment list
      of the last monster referenced, that is, the last M command previous to
      this command in the command table. Note that it is NOT necessary to
      precede this command with a 'G' command.

      <object vnum>        : The vnum of the object to be loaded.
      <max existing>       : This specifies the maximum number of the object
                             which can exist in the mud at one time.
      <equipment position> : This value determines where the object is equiped
                             on the mob. Use the values from the following
                             chart:

         WEAR_LIGHT           0 * Not imped
         WEAR_FINGER_R        1
         WEAR_FINGER_L        2

         WEAR_QUIVER         23 * Not imped

      P (TO Put an Object in Another Object)
      --------------------------------------
      Format: 'P' <if-flag> <object vnum1> <max existing> <object vnum2>

      This command loads object one and places it inside object two. Obviously,
      object two should be a container.

      <object vnum1> : The vnum of the first object to be loaded. (placed item)
      <max existing> : This specifies the maximum number of the first object
                       which can exist in the mud at one time
      <object vnum2> : The vnum of the second object to be loaded. (container)

      D (To Set the State of a Door)
      ------------------------------
      Format: 'D' <if-flag> <room vnum> <exit number> <door state>

      This command sets the state of the doors in a zone. Note that EACH side
      of the door must have a command in the table.

      <room vnum>   : The vnum of the room where this side of the door exists
      <exit number> : The direction of the exit, in this room. (Don't get the
                      different sides of the room confused!)
      <door state>  : Choose from the following:

         OPEN             0
         CLOSED           1
         CLOSED & LOCKED  2
          *Add 4 to the above for secret doors
           Add 8 to the above for blocked exits (See ITEM_SWITCH)

            CREATION STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR THE ZONE FILE
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Important Notes on making the .zon File:

1) Whatever you do, make SURE you comment your zone file.  You will see what
   we mean in the example below, but in brief, make sure that after every load
   you put in, write a comment after it to tell us (The Makers) what you are
   loading there.  This is a MUST, we will return the zone to you and tell you
   to comment it if you do not.

2) When you load a mob, the load looks like this: M 0 1234 5 9999
   Explanation: M 0 is always there, that tells the mud your loading a mob.
   The 1234 is the mob number, equal to the mob number in your .mob file.
   The 5 is the maximum number of that kind of mob in the world.  What this
   means is that There can be no more than 5 of mob #1234 in the world at any
   time.  If you choose 5 for this value, then there should be 5 mob loads
   in the zone table, not 1.  This number should = the number of loads you have
   for that mob in the .zon file, seen below.  The 9999 is the room number to
   which you are loading the mob.

3) Under NO circumstances are you to use any item or mob from another zone in
   your zone, UNLESS you first copy that object into you zone's files and
   renumber it to fit within your range..even this is frowned upon as we want
   you to make an original area. A notable exception to this are common,
   standardized items which may be found on a list later in these docs. Those
   items may be used anywhere you like, so long as you set the max existing
   value of those items high (99999) so they don't come into conflict with
   any other zones which will be using those same items.

4) Take care in assigning Temperature to the zone.  Freezing, Heatstroke and
   boiling all do damage every to a player.  Do NOT use those without a good
   reason.  (The Arctic would be freezing for example).

                        VII. THE SHOP FILE (.SHP)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
The shop file is used to make permanant shops or travelling shopkeepers and
salesmen. These files have several important features, such as:

        * Ability to have shop mobs that wander the world
        * Shop open and closing messages
        * Ability to allow a shopkeeper to stop/allow magic casting in their
          store
        * Setting of shopkeeper's hometown and race
        * Ability to make racist shopkeepers
        * Shops can produce up to 256 items
        * Shops can trade in 50 different item types
        * Shopkeepers list their items with corresponding numbers, so items
          can be bought by number or keyword

Creating a shop file is fairly complicated, so the format has been explained
in detail, section by section, below. Additionally, a couple of example
excerpts from working zones have been included at the end of this section.

Explanation of the Shop File Fields:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
#<shop number>~
   The beginning of each shop entry starts with a number sign (#) and then
   the number of the shopkeeper mob (this will also be the shop number). Note
   that this is NOT the number of the shop ROOM. This number must be followed
   by a tilde (~).

      EX:  #11524~

N
   On the next line, place a capital 'N'. Note that there is no tilde after
   this 'N'. The capital N marks the shop files as being in the 'new' format,
   since there will be no old format shops created, these are no longer
   explained.

<List of items produced by shop>
   Here is where you should list all of the items that this shop produces.
   That is, the items that a shopkeeper will never run out of, ones the
   players can buy repeatedly. List each of these items on a seperate line
   and when that list is complete, place a zero (0) on the next line.

      EX:  364      ------  Item one
           11528    ------  Item two
           398      ------  Item three
           399      ------  Item four
           11531    ------  Item five
           11563    ------  Item six
           0        <------ The zero denoting the end of the item list

<Multiplier for how much shopkeeper buys an item for>  (0.0 - 1.0)
   On this line, put in a decimal value that will indicate how much below
   object value the shopkeeper will be willing to pay for an item.

      EX: Assume a player has a sword which is worth 100 copper coins and that
      they sell it to a shopkeeper. This value will determine how much the
      shopkeeper will give the player for it. This value can range from
      0.1 to 1.0 and should not exceed 1.0, in general being < 1.0. The lower
      the value, the less the shopkeeper will pay for the item.

      0.5   <---- if the value were this, the shopkeeper would pay 50 copper
                  coins for the sword ( i.e. 0.5 X <item value> )

   Note that these values must have one decimal place, even if the number
   in an integer.

<Multiplier for how much profit shopkeeper gets when selling item> ( > 1.0)
   On this line, put in a decimal value that will indicate how much profit
   the shopkeeper will receive when they sell an item to a PC, or in other
   words how much an object will cost (displayed with list command).

      EX: Assume a player has the same sword as above, with a value of 100
      copper coins, that they buy from this shopkeeper. This value will
      determine how much the shop will sell the item for and its value can
      range from 1.0 and up. The higher the value, the more expensive the
      shopkeeper's items will be.

      1.5   <---- if the value were this, the shopkeeper would sell the
                  sword for 150 copper coins (i.e. 1.5 X <item value> )
   Note that these values must have one decimal place, even if the number
   in an integer.

<List of item types traded by shopkeeper>
   On the following lines, you will list all of the item types which the
   shopkeeper will buy. List each of these on a seperate line, followed
   by a zero (0) when you are done. You can put up to 50 different values
   here. The listing of object ITEM_TYPES has been reproduced below for your
   convience. If the shop doesn't buy anything, such as a bar, put just the
   zero (0) in this spot.

      EX:  5  ------ Item_Type Weapon
           9  ------ Item_Type Armor

<various shop messages>
   This section of the shop file containes seven lines of messages that the
   shopkeeper uses to interact with the players. Each message begins with a
   %s and ends with a tilde (~), with each message being on a seperate line.

   Format:
   %s Message used when a player tries to buy an item the shop does not have~
   %s Message used when player tries to sell an item they don't have~
   %s Message used when player tries to sell something the shop doesn't buy~
   %s Message used when player tries to sell an item which the shopkeeper
      cannot afford~
   %s Message used when player tries to buy an item they cannot afford~
   %s Message used when shopkeeper sells an item to a player %s~
   %s Message used when shopkeeper buys an item from a player %s~

   Note: The ending %s's on the last two lines are for coin messages and need
         to be included. The %s can be moved around within the body of the
         message wherever you want the number of coins for buy/sell to be
         displayed. For example, you could do the following:

     %s That'll be %s coins for that fine weapon, thanks for the business.~

   Also, these messages can only be ONE line long, with a tilde at the end.

   0
   0

   After the shop messages, the next two lines both have zeros (0) on them.
   These MUST be included.

<shopkeeper's mob number>
   This line contains the virtual number <mob vnum> of the shopkeeper. This
   is the same number which is used in the .mob file.

      EX:  11524  ------ This would be mob vnum 11524

   0

   The next line of the file contains a zero, this must be added and is the
   only thing on this line.

<shopkeeper's shop number - 0 if roaming>
   This line has one number, the number of the room where the shopkeeper sells
   their goods. It corresponds to the room number of the shop in the .wld
   file. If the shopkeeper roams, and has no permanant room they are in,
   put a zero (0) in for this value.

      EX:  11527  ------ This is the shopkeeper's room, room vnum 11527

<First opening time>
<First close time>
<Second opening time - 0 if not used>
<Second closing time - 0 if not used>
   These four values are used to determine when a shop is open and when it
   is closed. All of the times are listed in military time (0-23), and there
   are two possible opening and closing times. As an example, a shopkeeper
   could open at 6AM (6), close for lunch at noon (12), re-open at 1PM (13)
   and close for the night at 9PM (21). This shopkeeper would then have the
   collowing entry:

      EX:  6
           12
           13
           21

   Notes: For shops that stay open 24 hours a day, put a zero (0) in the
   first opening time and a twenty-eight (28) for the first close time.
   Then, the other two closing times would be zeros (0). Twenty-eight is
   used to indicate that the shope closes ont he 28th hours, i.e. never.
   
***Generally ALL shops should be open 24 hours a day. Having shops closed
   during part of the ‘day’ just reduces the playability of the mud.


<Flag - Does shop roam? Y = yes, N = No>
   This line determines whether or not the shop roams the world or is
   stationary within their place of business. Put a capital Y (yes) if the
   shop roams and a capital N (no) if it does not roam.

      EX:  N  ------ Thus, this shopkeeper does not roam


<Flag - Is shop NO_MAGIC? Y = Yes, N = No>
   This line is used to determine whether or not the shopkeeper allows
   players to use magic or cast spells within the shop. Put a capital Y
   (yes) if the shopkeeper does prevent magic use (no-magic) or a capital
   N (no) if the shopkeeper does allow magic to be cast.

      EX:  N  ------ Thus, this shopkeeper allows magic to be cast


<Flag - Is shopkeeper killable? Y = Yes, N = No>
   This line is used to determine whether or not the shopkeeper can be attacked
   by typing "hit shopkeeper" or "kill shopkeeper". Put a capital Y (yes)
   if the shopkeeper does prevent normal attack or a capital N (no) if the
   shopkeeper does not prevet normal attack and can be killed with hit/kill.

      EX:  N  ------ Thus, this shopkeeper can be attacked normally

**Note:There are still ways to kill shopkeepers, for this reason ALL 
Shopkeepers have a special death proc that causes ALL items they are 
wearing to disappear after they die.  This means that items/eq that
are worn by the shopkeeper will be VERY difficult (though not impossible)
to obtain.

<Opening message>~
   This is the message used when the shop opens for business and is spoken
   by the shopkeeper. Note that the end of the line must have a tilde (~)
   on it.

      EX:  I am now open for business~

<Closing message>~
   This is the message used when the shop closes for business and is spoken
   by the shopkeeper. Note that the end of the line must have a tilde (~)
   on it.

      EX:  I am closed, come back later!~

<hometown flag>
   Currently this flag is not used. Later it will be used to identify the
   town associated with shopkeepers, for now just make it zero (0).

      EX:  0  ------ Zero, not associated with any hometown for now.

<social action types>
    This flag is for Social Action Types. This flag is also not currently in
    use but, in the future, it will be used for the support of mobile
    interaction with other players. When in, this flag will determine how the
    shopkeeper responds to socials and actions directed against or at it. For
    now, just put in a 0.

<Flag - Is shopkeeper racist? Y = Yes, N = No>
   This line determines if the shopkeeper is a racist. If the shopkeeper is
   a racist, they will not deal with anyone but their own race. If this line
   is a capital Y (yes) the shopkeeper is a racist. If the line is a capital
   N (no), the shopkeeper is not a racist.

      EX:  Y  ------ Thus, the shopkeeper is a racist.

In general, I prefer ‘good’ race shopkeepers not be racists, this just causes
people to ‘roll-up’ a pc of that race to buy something and generally reduces
playability.  Evils are supposed to have a hard time but will probably use the
same ‘roll-up’ route around racism.

<Shopkeeper's race>
   This line defines the shopkeeper's race and uses the following values:

    Human.......1       Barbarian..........2     Drow Elf.........3
    Grey Elf....4       Mountain Dwarf.....5     Duergar Dwarf....6
    Halfling....7       Gnome..............8     Ogre.............9
    Troll.......10      Half Elf...........11

      EX:  10 ------ Shopekeeper is a troll

Message: When racist shopkeeper turns player of opposing race away.~
   This line defines the nasty message a shopkeeper will use when he denys
   business to those of another race. Note that the message must be followed
   with a tilde (~).

      EX:  Buzz off freak!~

X
   The last line of the shop file should have a capital X on it.

Each qst mob starts with '#' and the mob id.  Follow
by any number of M or Q sub-format.  Each mob ends with
'S'.  '#~' to end the whole qst file.

Explanation:
When the player tell/ask this mob and the message contains
either 'home' or 'scroll', the mob will reply to player
with the above message.

   more than one D-format, then the last D-format is used]

For example:
  Q
  He says, 'Thank you for bringing this sword to me and giving me
  1000 gold coins.  For your generosity, I will teach you the secret
  of the spell 'resurrection'.  Here's a map to the inner dungeon.
  You may find it useful if you do decide to explore further into
  the dungeon.'
  ~
  R S <resurrection id>
  G I <sword id>
  G C 1000
  R I <map id>
  D
  Then he waves good-bye to you and disappears.

  ~

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Note: If there is more than 1 G-format defined for the Q-format, then
    qst mob must have all the G-format items before it will release
    the quest message to the player.  For example, a mob quest is defined
    with 'G I 1234' and 'G C 5678'.  Then quest is only consider complete,
    if the mob has item #1234 and more than 5678 gold coins.

            CREATION STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR THE QUEST FILE
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Hmmm, no real standards here that don’t follow common sense.  Basically make
certain that equipment provided is in line with the difficulty of the quest.
You should note that not all quest mobs need to give out items of any type.
The ‘message’ portion of the quest file for a particular mob can be used to
provide information or clues to the solution of other quests or finding 
other items or areas.

You should also note that it is nice to ‘challenge’ players.  For mid-high
level zones it is not only acceptable but encouraged to create quests that use
random-load rooms to randomly load mobs all over the world.  This will force 
players to explore other zones.  For example, Bill’s magic shoelace has been 
stolen by ‘Juan the Despicable’ who has fled the (country, village, continent)
and Bill will pay handsomely for their return.  You can also create multi-step
quests that can be limited by loading mobs only a certain % of the time.  This
adds a certain challenge to the completion of the quest, making it at least
slightly different each time the PCs try to complete it.

                              IX. APPENDICES
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
                     APPENDIX I. THE DURIS ANSI CODES
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Duris has several ANSI codes which can be used to add color to the long
descriptions, short descriptions, and extra descriptions of rooms, mobs and
objects. Note: Do NOT use these colors in the "keywords" listings, because
mortals cannot use ANSI codes, they will be unable to type those keywords. In
the future there may be "features" which use ANSI characters and keywords for
code recognition purposes. If so, those features will be added to these docs.

First things first.  The main thing to understand when using our version of
ansi color is:  you can SET things, or CLEAR ALL (back to white on black), but
you cannot just turn off bold, or blink.

There are 4 types of ansi control sequences:
&<N>|<n> -   reset everything, back to 'n'ormal (white on black).  This is also
             done for every newline, to eliminate 'bleed-through' colors.
&+<color> -  set foreground color.  If the color letter is uppercase, the BOLD
             (bright/light) bit is also set (and will STAY set) until either
             a newline, or &<N> is done.
&-<color> -  set background color.  If the color letter is uppercase, the BLINK
             bit will be set (same as for &+ above).
&=<bg><fg> - set both background <bg> and foreground <fg> color, exactly the
             same restrictions as for setting foreground and background
             seperately.

w - white    l - black    r - red    b - blue    g - green
y - yellow   c - cyan     m - magenta
(+w is normal text, +W is bold text)

Examples: &+GA bright green leaf juts out from the tree branch overhead.&N
          &=LRThis is flashing red on a black background.&N

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
                   APPENDIX II. A FEW HINTS AND TRICKS
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

   Ok, I don’t know how much I am going to put here at the moment but I will
certainly expand this later.  Basically, I want to use this space to mention
a few anomalies that occur with the loading of mobs and objects on all Diku
muds and a few suggestions to get around some of them.  If you have a great
deal of experience writing areas all of many of these things will already be
known to you.

   If a mob is set to load in the .zon file, it will always load upon the 
‘reset’ or ‘repop’ of the zone.  This means that a mob you might want to load
‘at random’ because it is a quest mob, particularily high level, or has a
rare piece of equipment NEEDS to be loaded through a random mob loading room.
As I recall there should be an example of this somewhere in these docs but I
can’t find it right now so I will describe it again.  A series of rooms can
be set up that have exits to each other, and one-way exits to rooms in your 
zone (or other zones).  Some of these exits can go to a ‘Mob Holding Room’--
a room with NO exits that is NO_TELEPORT, NO_RECALL, NO_SUMMON--ALL mob 
loading rooms should have these flags so that PCs can’t summon mobs out or
randomly teleport in.

Ex:
______    ______       ______      ______ 
 Rm A ---> Rm B ------> Rm C -----> Rm D ---->to a room
--+---    --+---       --+---      --+---
  ^         ^            ^           ^
Exits to a Mob holding room----

The above rooms each have two one-way exits (the mob can leave the room but
there is no exit for it to return to the room).  A mob loaded in room A has
a 50% chance of moving into room B and a 50% chance of moving to a Mob 
Holding Room, once that mob is in room B it has a 50% chance of moving into 
room C and a 50% chance of moving to a Mob Holding Room, etc.  As you can see,
A mob loaded in room A will only load a VERY small % of the time.  To add to the
randomness, the mob can load from room D into a series of rooms that all have
exits into different parts of your zone, or really any other zone in throughout
Duris (Be reasonable, an ‘abominable snowman’ loading in the Elemental Plane of
Fire would be a bit silly... ).  It is important to note that ANY mob loaded 
into the above rooms MUST NOT have the SENTINAL flag or it will NEVER load.

  Clearly, if you have a forest and want to randomly load mobs throughout it
a series of rooms can be made with one-way exits into different forest rooms 
that will spread out the mobs and prevent PCs from ‘sitting’ on ‘repop sites’.

  One of the oddities of mob-loading on Diku muds comes from the order the 
program reads in mob-loads.  In a .zon file a mob load looks like this:

M 0 1 2 1 (Mob #1 loads in Room #1 with a limit of 2 in the world)
M 0 1 2 2 (Mob #1 loads in Room #2 with a limit of 2 in the world)
Etc..

In the above example, if a pc kills mob #1 in room #2 but NOT in Room #1
the program will load a second Mob #1 in room #1 upon Zone reset (repop).
Why?  Because the program reads the first line which tells it to load
Mob #1 in room #1 IF there are less than 2 of that mob in the world.  By 
the time the program reads the next line (load Mob #1 in room #2 if there 
are less than 2 of that mob in the world), there will already be two of 
that mob and itwon’t load another in room #2.

   Generally, this is not a problem with wandering mobs, it does cause some
strange looking rooms when ‘sentinal’ flagged mobs come into play.  This is why
you might find a number of ‘guards’, ‘sentinals’, or other stationary mobs in a
single room a number of hours after the game has been running.  The only way
around this for ‘sentinal’ mobs is to create several copies of the mob with
different vnums and make a single load of each different vnum into each room.
It is something to keep in mind if you want to load guards or sentinal mobs
of some sort in different rooms.

Object Loading;
   Well, this is fun, I can’t remember all the things I was going to put here.
Generally most objects are loaded on particular mobs, and many of the better
or rarer items only load at ‘reboot’ when the game is initially started. 
Many of you now know that it is possible to ‘rent’ or ‘camp’ with an item
before a zone resets and have the reset load another item.  This is a cheap,
twinky way to mud and MOST players on Duris don’t attempt this.  In any case
it is nice to create situations where PCs won’t be certain whether or not a
mob will have a certain item.  There are several ways to do this:

   The first, and perhaps easiest, is to place the items on mobs that load 
through a set of loading rooms like those described above.

   The second is to load a set of mobs with ‘scavanger’ flags in a mob loading 
room that runs through a second room before the mobs load into the game.  Items 
can be loaded in the second room (the one without the mobs).  The first mob to 
wander into the room with the items will pick them ALL up.  It is important to
note that items loaded in this fashion MUST be visible and MUST NOT be hidden/
secret, and that the first mob into the room will pick ALL of the items up ie.
This is only good for loading a few items.  In addition the room should have a
magical light so that the items can be seen by the mobs.  Hmmm... Come to think 
of it if you are doing this with evil race mobs you should make the room
‘indoors’ and ‘twilight’, in fact that should work for all mobs...

   The third way is to create quests.  The coded quest system is quite powerful
and is a good way to limit the numbers of certain items in the game.  When 
creating quests, specially multi-step quests, you should remember to flag items
no_rent where appropriate.  After all, we don’t want people able to do the work
once and then complete the quest over and over again.  Quest mobs and items can
be used in conjuction with the random mob loading system above to make the
quests much more difficult and create new challenges for the PCs.

  The fourth way....   Well, Fafhrd is working on a system to randomly load 
pieces of equipment on mobs for the mapping system that has been put in 
recently.  I am sure a way will be found to apply that system to areas in the
mud.

   I am sure that I am leaving out a ton of small things, but for those of you
that have never written areas before I hope this will help some.  For those of
you with tons of area writing experience that notice any mistakes or omissions,
please go ahead and email me and I will make appropriate corrections and
additions.

           APPENDIX III. A LIST OF NUMBERS FOR SOME COMMON OBJECTS
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
The following common objects are standardized for use on Duris Mud. You may
use any of these object numbers in your .zon, .shp or .qst file to make use
of that particular object. DO NOT make copies of these objects in your .obj
files! These objects were made so that multiple, redundant copies of often
used objects could be eliminated. For example, if you want to put some iron
rations on your town's shopkeeper, just use Object #364 instead of making
your own iron rations. You are of course encouraged to come up with your own
original objects, but this large list should provide you with multitudes of
common objects to flesh out your zone and save you valuable creation time.

NOTE: This exhaustive list was prepared by Zarland many ages ago.  I am not
energetic enough to go through it and add things or to go through and double
check everything.  Please feel free to use any of these objects in your
zones but ALWAYS set the limit to 99999.
