Changes between durisEdit 2.99de and 2.99d

 FEATURES ADDED

  + when looking at objects, mobs, and your inventory, contents of containers are now shown, unless you
    set the 'ShowObjContents' variable to false (can also use the 'displayconfig' menu)
  + the screen will now pause for virtually everything, including looking at rooms, objects, mobs, and
    your inventory
  + default extra desc, quest, and shop are now available
  + inventory is now read from and written to the <zonename>.inv file
  + flag-style menus now respect both screen height and width when determining number of columns and
    spacing
  + the 'get all' command now picks up mobs as well as objects
  + you can now pick up extra descs and drop them in rooms and put them in objects
  + a list of valid command-line arguments now appears with the -?, -h, or --help command-line argument
  + the Win32 version now only overwrites existing zone files on a new zone when you save
  + pausing now always ensures that nothing will scroll off the screen
  + rewrote inventory code to remove various inconsistencies
  + 'key' command can now be used on object types that aren't actually ITEM_KEY
  + Win32 version now specifically says 'Press a key to exit...' once you've exited, since otherwise
    it looks suspiciously like DE has just hung
  + Unix version now prompts for a keypress when exiting since the screen disappears on exit
  + room sector and object liquid editing menus now have color
  + added check for shop opening time before closing time, disallowed improper data when changing opening/
    closing times
  + improved efficiency of input and output code - this change also makes DE behave better in ultra-low
    memory situations
  + keywords, variable names, and alias names no longer must be uppercase
  + area file-reading code is now more flexible about lowercase zone command letters, lowercase quest 
    specifier letters, etc
  + the create and delete commands can create and delete aliases and variables
  + rewrote command interpreter - which means DE >
    + uses less memory, so is more usable in low-memory situations 
    + will detect endlessly looping aliases and variables and abort without locking up
    + allows aliases and variables to reference one another for a long, long time, unlike before where 
      only two levels of reference were followed
    + allows dereferencing of variables from the main prompt
  + 'list commands' is now another way to do the 'commands' command
  + made some zone loading errors more clear
  + cleaned up the source code - g_ before all globals, fewer globals, no cout because it is massive


 BUGS FIXED

  * as of 2.99, you could (basically) no longer load zones from directories other than DE's directory
  * some oddness with object and object edesc targeting using dot notation (3.sword, etc.)
  * better error handling for low memory situations - DE will now only die if it absolutely must; the
    most important new non-dying place is probably when writing a zone file
  * aborting a 'create room' command halfway through could cause oddness
  * creating and deleting the default room's exits would alter the 'number of exits in zone' counter
  * on load, DE counted default room's exits in the 'number of exits in zone' counter
  * zone writing could crash with max length object or mob short name
  * 'goto' and 'at' commands wouldn't always find an existing object/mob target
  * changed Arctic sector type map display from exactly like desert to cyan background
  * description end lines that were only spaces were not immediately removed
  * the affect3 flag 'Has four arms' is now properly supported
  * objects with multiple wear locations were not always equipping to the desired slot on a zone load
  * removed incorrect check for obsolete 'weapon damage' value in weapons (val4)
  * readded proper vowelization of a/an before mob species when looking at a mob
  * deleting an alias or variable didn't count as a change
  * no longer allowed to drop a shop in a room that already has one
  * fixed various issues with multiple shop mobs in one room
  * 'stat obj' command now shows all 8 object values




Changes between durisEdit 2.99d and 2.99c

 FEATURES ADDED

  + menus now adjust for screen width and are more consistent
  + increased maximum length of zone name to 128 characters (was 80)
  + linkroom command now resets the destinations of existing exits rather than ignoring them
  + added 'maxvnum' command, allowing you to change the current maximum vnum from inside DE
  + the vnum limit is now automatically increased if you hit the current maximum limit when 
    loading a zone, creating a room/object/mob, or renumbering
  + the source will now compile cleanly with 64-bit targets (X-bit really, where X >= 32)


 BUGS FIXED

  * you could use the 'edit shop #' command to create a shop for mobs that were loaded more than once
  * didn't realize changes had been made when creating a shop from 'edit shop' command
  * 'set all check options on/off' menu command in main check menu wasn't setting all variables, ditto 
    for misc check menu
  * adding ID edescs to an object and then aborting the additions would cause a crash
  * aborting editing an object's trap info didn't restore the trap level
  * would think changes had been made when editing an object or mob's limit, regardless of whether you
    had actually changed it
  * Win32 didn't always completely clear the screen
  * possible crash/odd behavior when deleting a mob type
  * 'delete unused' command would not delete objects only referenced by quests/shops of mobs that have
    just been deleted due to being unused
  * if .SET file's 'savestartroom' var wasn't false and its 'startroom' var pointed to a non-existent 
    room, DE would crash on startup
  * you can no longer load a zone file with a room, object, or mob with a vnum of 0
  * running out of memory in low memory situations no longer causes DE to always just exit
  * the input field for the 'set zone number' command was not properly initialized
  * renumbering could lose rooms/objects/mobs and possibly lead to a crash, specifically if you
    renumbered to a vnum that collided with the highest room/obj/mob vnum + the number of rooms/objs/
    mobs (i.e. to 2000 if your highest room vnum was 1500 and you had 1000 rooms)
  * the input fields for the 'goto' and 'jump' prompts were not properly initialized
  * if you stat'd a mob with many classes, DE could crash
  * if you stat'd a room or object with many edesc keywords, DE could crash
  * mob hometown was displayed as unsigned in menus instead of signed
  * prompt would not display on a new line if you hit 'Q' after stat'ing zone

  + Unix version of DE will now show unused portion of field with grey background rather than with
    whatever strange character your terminal wants to show
  + improved the output of various commands, namely load obj, load mob, create room, clone, create
    object type, create mob type, delete mob type, delete mobhere, delete object type, delete objhere,
    delete quest, and delete shop
  + you can now 'create objhere/oh' and 'create mobhere/mh' as well as 'load obj' and 'load mob'

  + if a default room has exits, they are now copied into rooms as they are created.  if there is a
    would-be 'exit collision' when creating a room from either the 'create room' command or walkcreate 
    mode, the exit copied from the default room is deleted and replaced
  + a zone with the 'map' flag set is now considered a map zone by DE

    on an error, and blank lines anywhere in a file will now be ignored




 BUGS FIXED

  * mob editing treated aff2 flags like aff1 flags
  * the 'massset' command would set the wrong flags for objects and mobs
  * DE sometimes incorrectly thought the text editor had not loaded successfully
  * certain aliases would crash DE
  * nothing was shown when setting a variable to the value it already had
  * filename passed to 'dumptextcolor' command was being uppercased
  * too-long room name would make edit current direction header too long, too-long object name would
    make edit craftsmanship, trap aff, and trap damage header too long, and too-long mob name would 
    make edit default position header too long
  * aborting the viewing of a text file (including the help files) would not close the file handle, 
    which could potentially lead to being unable to save files or view any other text files if you 
    aborted enough views
  * scrollback buffer in Win32 version was not being entirely cleared when clearing the screen for 
    menu display, causing garbage to appear as you entered more commands after exiting the menu
  * memory leak in 'stat mob' command when no args passed or mob can't be found
  * crash with a quest that gave many, many, many things to the PC
  * memory leak when aborting display of zone exits list
  * zone number being set from 'edit zone' menu regardless of whether you cancelled changes or not
  * crash when using 'unmount' command
  * zone difficulty would not reset if you cancelled out of editing zone info
  * you could sometimes put all into a non-container object
  * you could take a mob that was being followed
  * you could purge a mob that was being followed/being ridden/riding
  * memory leaks when taking all from a mob/object by vnum and when trying to take something from
    a mob by vnum that isn't carrying anything
  * memory leak when attempting to put an object on the fly (by vnum) into an invalid entity
  * color codes in valid &=xy code were shown reversed when 'display Duris color codes' was on
  * too-long header on flag-editing menus would cause the first column to be offset by one
  * a bad & code at the end of a line would cause only a blank line to be displayed
  * when creating a grid, the last room was not properly hooked up to the grid and an extra unused
    room was created - this bug may also have caused strange crashes as you continued to use DE
  * a few editing prompts in the menus were yellow instead of cyan
  * you couldn't edit the vnum of a room/object/mob created from a default room/object/mob until you
    quit and reloaded DE
  * the F1-F12 keys are now recognized in Win32
  * changed the '!' template key for Unix to '~'
  * cursor position was not being reset properly when setting flags from a template
  * 'toggle' command was not ignoring everything after a space
  * the check for an object that wasn't usable by anyone (due to anti race/class flags) would 
    incorrectly report some usable objects as unusable
  * an existing default room will now be copied into the first room of a new zone
  * 'pause every screenful' code was counting short by one line per likely screen
  * 'artisan' was misspelled as 'artisian'
  * extra spaces when editing keywords no longer result in 'keyword(s)' that are only a space
  * 'createedit exit' command simply didn't do anything.  I must not have ever tested it
  * aborting editing an object or mob type now resets the override limit if you changed it
  * if you had multiple containers of the same type in a room or mob's inventory, the contents of every
    container of that type would get written into the last container of the type, regardless of which
    actual container they should be in
  * the contents of a container that contained a container of its own type would not always be written
    properly - though due to limitations in the method Duris uses for placing things in containers,
    you can still easily have things written incorrectly when having containers that contain the same 
    type as themselves
  * the 'setrandom' command would not work on mobs by keyword
  * the 'edit exits' menu sometimes did not allow you to edit some exits
  * you couldn't look at or setrandom an object that had keywords that didn't match any of its edescs
  * DE now displays a message when attempting to get/drop/put all and there is nothing to actually g/d/p
  * DE didn't think you had made zone changes when setting a new random percentage on an object or mob




Changes between durisEdit 2.99b and 2.99

  merged the changes between Duris' latest version of DE (provided by Tharkun) with the changes I
  made since 2.98i, adding the following:

   * new flags for rooms, objects, and mobs, new classes, new hometowns, and new sector type
   * colored names for race and class

  if you have a zone that was made in any version of DE other than the Duris-made versions after 
  my 2.98i, you'll have to update your object anti and anti2 flags

  fixed bug whereby cloning rooms with mobs carrying/equipping objects in them would have increased
  the 'objects loaded' amounts erroneously - mostly harmless

  made list room and list exit commands always show rooms sorted by vnum

  fixed bugs with equipping items, some of which I thought I fixed 8000 years ago - it's all better
  now

  'list limit' is now another way to 'list loaded'

  thanks to whoever made the makefile for DE on Duris, the DE source archive now contains a makefile
  that should work under any version of Unix (though I specifically tested it under Linux) - ncurses
  is required



Changes between dikuEdit 2.98j and durisEdit 2.99

  changed name of dikuEdit to durisEdit, since I'm not even sure it will edit stock Diku areas or
  any areas anywhere other than Duris'

  fixed all renumber bugs once and for all - renumber anywhere you want (below loaded limit)

  when running DE without any command-line arguments under Win32 (such as when double-clicking the
  icon), the user is prompted to open/create a zone and standard Win32 Open/New File dialogs appear

  increased internal buffer sizes to prevent overflows (crashes) everywhere: file reading, user input,
  file writing

  fixed 'check for valid object material' option stating that it only checked armor/worn despite the
  fact that it checks all objects

  updated 'which' command to check mob class flags

  updated 'massset' command to recognize mob class flags

  updated flags.txt file

  changed the flag menus to better respect the screen width setting

  screen width and height now have absolute minimums - 40 for width, 15 for height

  fixed various memory leaks, including when stat'ing an object that doesn't exist, when putting/
  giving/taking something, when screen width is too small to display a map, and in certain cases when 
  looking at things

  fixed 'dumptext' and 'dumptextcolor' commands not always keeping track of number of lines properly
  and not displaying the final line if the final line wasn't terminated with a linefeed

  fixed 'changes made to zone' not being set in certain circumstances (editing quest from 'edit quest'
  command, others)

  increased maximum lengths of various things, such as room names, object names, variables, aliases ..

  fixed bug with hitting delete/backspace as first character not displaying field as cleared

  fixed bug with right arrow'ing past end of field not working properly

  generally cleaned up 'field editing' code for speed and goodness

  the SHELL and FREESTACK commands now only work under Watcom - in particular SHELL crashed Win32

  made 'get all', 'drop all', and 'give/put all' work better

  fixed bugs that probably existed with dropping/getting objects and mobs and limits, or maybe they 
  didn't, but it definitely works now

  fixed minor display bug with displaying a room that contains objects not in the zone

  fixed 'list loaded' command not working with no arguments

  fixed 'list loaded' command not displaying anything if no match to arguments was found

  fixed aliases always being uppercased when read from .SET file

  changed 'lookup room', 'list room', and 'list obj' commands to ignore color codes in room names 
  when searching

  fixed bug with 'settemplate' list code wherein the screen would pause too often

  changed descriptions of quest rewards/requirements to be.. more descriptive

  fixed various display bugs whereby max length names would cause menu headers to take more than one
  line

  fixed '_settextposition(): SetConsoleCursorPosition() call failed' messages that occasionally 
  appeared in Win32 version

  fixed create/delete exit prompt (shown when editing rooms or when typing 'del exit' or 'create 
  exit') not working properly

  changed many things internally such that DE is more efficient (faster)

  changed all file writing/reading functions to allow longer filenames

  fixed bug in Win32 input-grabbing such that multiple keypresses may have been missed under extremely
  high latency (laggy) conditions, such as on a slow computer that is calculating Pi to the eight
  trillionth digit.. though I could never induce enough lag on my own (low- to mid-range) system

  Win32 version will now wait for a final keypress after user quits, so that they can see the final
  output

  fixed bug that could cause low/high limits not to be reset when changing a room/object/mob's vnum,
  causing one or more items not to be written

  vnums of 0 are no longer allowed for anything anywhere

  list room/object/mob commands now always display the list sorted by vnum

  the 'trying to put an object inside a non-container object' error in zone reading is now a bypassable
  warning

  aliases containing semicolons can now be defined from the prompt

  fixed problems with combining mounts, mounters, and following



Changes between dikuEdit 2.98i and 2.98j

  made arrow keys and home/end/delete work in Win32 version

  made 'notepad' the default text editor for Win32 version

  any text editor that takes command line arguments will now properly work under Win32

  fixed bug in dikuEdit's description editing code that would have ignored any lines at the end 
  that didn't have carriage returns - was never noticed because EDIT always adds a CR

  changed Win32 version to pop up a message box if you try to run DE with no command-line
  arguments (i.e. by double-clicking on it)

  updated the email address shown by the 'version' command
