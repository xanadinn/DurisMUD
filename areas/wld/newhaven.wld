&+w   Six sets of &+yflagpoles&+w have been meticulously spaced and embedded along each
&+wside of the &+Lcobblestone&+w path leading up to a massive &+Cgate&+w.  Each &+ypole&+w supports
&+weither a large &+cba&+Cn&+cn&+Cer&+w emblazoned with &+LNewhaven&+w's crest or a large &+Wscale&+w and
&+cbalance&+w.  The &+yroadway&+w has been formed from tiny dark brown &+ystones&+w and has been
&+Lmortared&+w tightly together.  The area is very picturesque.  The lush &+Gla&+gn&+Gd&+gsc&+Ga&+gp&+Ge
&+wof the area is offset by the vibrant colors of the many wild &+Rfl&+ro&+Rw&+rer&+Rs&+w that have
&+wsprouted about the &+yflagpoles&+w.  The &+yroadway&+w is completely free of any &+Ldebris
