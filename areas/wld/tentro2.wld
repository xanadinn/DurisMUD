&+gThe Edge of a Great Wide Plain&n~
&+g   A large and spacious field opens up before you here.  The field is long and
&+gvery wide.  There are many tufts of lush green grass that can be seen even at
&+ga very great distance.  The sky opens very wide above the field as there are
&+gno trees at all to break up the skyline. One can see many miles of open prairie
&+gto the north.  One may travel to the north into the field or south out of the
&+gentire bowl shaped area.&N

&+gUpon the Field of Endolin&N~
&+g   The Field of Endolin is a very lush and healthy prairie.  The sod here has
&+ggrown solid with a tough looking grass.  The grass is a dark green and very
&+gstrong.  There are many trails leading off further onto the field.  There are
&+gsome &+ybuffalo chips&+g lying on the ground.  It has been said by the older native
&+Bbarbarians &+gthat the &+ybuffalo chips&+g can be used as a fire starter.  There are
&+gmiles of prairie stretching out to the north.  One may travel in any direction.&N

&+gUpon the Lush Grasses of The Field of Endolin&N~
&+g   The Fields of Endolin have been this large and wide open plain that lies
&+gbefore you for centuries.  The entire area was once covered with tons of ice
&+gand rock as the large glaciers moved south.  The ground was not scarred like
&+gsome of the canyons in the western regions but actually was leveled totally
&+gflat.  The green grasses grow very well in the infertile soil of the prairie.
&+gThe grass is about all that grows here save an occasional weed.  One may travel
&+gto the north or east.&N

&+gOn the Grassy Plain&N~
&+g   This grassy plain is the home to many different kinds of animals.  The
&+ganimals live in peace usually, but the predators that live here need to live
&+gand eat as well.  Most of the creatures live off of the hearty grasses that
&+ggrow in great abundance here.  The plains are the ideal place in nature, too
&+gbig to ruin, yet one area of the plain is as peaceful as another.  The Field
&+gof Endolin is a very large field of grasses that is often traveled across by
&+gmerchants or travelers.  Armies rarely travel here, preferring to stick close
&+gto the mountain ranges, out of sight to their foes.  One may travel in any

&+gon the hearty grasses.  There is an entire eco-system evident here, the
&+gconstant perfection of the wonder of nature.  During the dry season these
&+ggrasses are often very crisp and dusty.  The sheer amount of open land seems
&+godd and frightening to any of those who originally came from villages or cities
&+gwith many buildings.  One may travel in any direction on the Field of Endolin.

&+gThe Edge of the Field of Endolin&N~
&+g   The Field of Endolin ends here when it reaches another region of the realm.
&+gThere is little difference between this part of the prairie and any other.  It
&+gseems that this entire region is the most boring area in all existence.  There
&+gare no civilizations, no communities, not even a wandering tribe of nomads.
&+gAll that lives here are animals and grass, not exactly exciting.  &+WWinter&+g is the
&+gonly time this region gets interesting, because that is when many animals can
&+geither starve to death or kill to live.  The &+ybuffalo&+g dig through the &+Wsnow&+g to
&+gget at the frozen blades of grass that help them survive the &+Wwinter&+g.  The many
&+yprairie dogs&+g try to store enough food to live through the &+Wwinter&+g, but the rest

&+Lburnt &+gprairie.  One may travel north or west.&N

&+gOn The Grasses of the Vast Prairie&N~
&+g   There are many small trails leading to the east, seeming to randomly start
&+gand end.  There seems to be a great deal of animals grazing here, more than
&+glikely because of the close proximity to the watering hole.  The Field of
&+gEndolin is a vast prairie, reaching far and wide.  The dark mass of the&+L Black
&+LDog Mountains &+gcan be seen to the northeast, an ominous reminder of the danger
&+gof this place.  The rumors that surround those mountains are more than a little
&+gscary.  One may travel in any direction on the grassy plain.&N

&+gThe Edge of the Vast Open Prairie&N~
&+g   The Field of Endolin effectively ends here as it meets with some of the
&+glower hills of the large mountain ranges to the north and west.  The grasses
&+ggrow significantly higher here, often undisturbed for a long while.  The grassy
&+gplain is very peaceful almost all times of the year.  Some years, when the
&+ghunting is bad in other regions, some wandering tribes will hunt the&+y buffalo
&+ghere instead of trying to find the diminishing herds in their regions.  One

&+gThe Natural Prairie&N~
&+g   The power of nature is evident here on the pristine grasses of the Field
&+gof Endolin.  This large prairie is well known in both myth and present times
&+gfor its abundance of animals.  The large and grassy plain has been untouched by
&+gany civilizations in fear of the wrath of nature.  Not once in this prairies
&+gexistence has a building or tent of any kind been erected on its natural
&+gsurface.  The grasses are long and healthy looking.  It is rumored that on a
&+gclear night one can become one with nature if they lie on the ground of the
&+gField of Endolin.  One may travel south or east.&N

&+g   This vast and grassy plain is filled with animals.  There are many &+ybuffalo
&+gand &+yprairie dogs&+g visible in the surrounding fields.  The grasses here grow to
&+gnearly waist high, but since there is so much animal activity the grasses lie
&+gmostly on the ground.  The grasses have naturally woven together making walking
&+gthrough these grasses difficult.  All around is the green of the grass making
&+gthis place feel very in tune to nature.  There are a few &+yprairie dog&+g holes dug

&+gNear the Foothills of the &+LBlack Dog Mountains&N~

&+gThe harshness of the mountains is daunting as one gazes up at their snow-capped

&+gThe animals that live here don't give this place much thought, as to them it
&+gis just some more grass to run upon.  However, to the druids of the realms,
&+gthis is a powerful place.  There is a lot of magical energy here for druids
&+gto tap into.  There are many small holes dug by the prairie dogs.  There are

&+Lreal and very dangerous to anyone foolish enough to intrude.  The cave is dark
&+Land filled with many of the vile &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L warriors.  The &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+Gs&+L are a
&+Lsavage people who crave &+Chuman&+L flesh and often will raid the surrounding areas
&+Lfor food and other valuables.  This cave is well hidden beneath the Black Dog

&+L   This dark and scary cave is inhabited by a race of highly effective and
&+Ldeadly fighters.  The &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L race is savage and can easily overcome an
&+Lunready opponent.  The warriors of the clan are trained from an early age how
&+Lto fully use all of their weapons including their long tail.  This cave is the
&+Lperfect lair for such a race.  Because the darkness is so complete, ambushes
&+Lcan and will happen as one goes further into this place.  The advanced eyes of
&+Lthe&+g tr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte &+Lrace has developed a superior form of infravision which allows
&+Lthem to best take advantage of these surroundings.  The smell is horrible,
&+Lemitted from their glands and pores as yet another deterrent from this place.

&+LIn the Dark &+gTr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L Caves&N~
&+L   The further into the &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte &+Lcaves the more disorienting it becomes.
&+LEven creatures with phenomenal infravision find this place to be a complex and
&+Lconfusing cave system.  The darkness, combined with the horrible smells that
&+Lthe &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+Gs&+L release from their glands, makes the air seem to be thick like
&+Lwater.  The rocks are cold and wet and sound does not seem to carry very well
&+Lthis far down.  Normally there would be an echo, but here there is none.  It
&+Lis as if a shadow of darkness has stolen all the light and sound from this
&+Lplace.  Even with a torch one cannot see very far ahead.  Shadows seem to dance
&+Land merge into the stone.  Or perhaps the&+g tr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte &+Lwarriors are preparing to
&+Lattack.  The &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+Gs&+L posses an innate ability to change the color and tone
&+Lof their flesh to fit in with their surroundings.  It is safe to assume that an
&+Ladult &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L could blend in with the black rock and stand there invisible
&+Lto someone who walked by.  One may walk north, south or west.  The darkness
&+Lmakes it hard to determine which is the main path.&N

&+Lthis cave can safely navigate through such perils.  The air is very musty and

&+Lsilence is strange and menacing.  One may travel to the north or west from this
&+Lpoint in the &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L cave system.&N

&+LIn the Dark &+gTr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L Caves&N~
&+L   The dark tunnels and caves of the &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L cave system continues to wind
&+Lthrough the cold stone of this underground region.  The darkness here is an
&+Lever present menace, always lurking nearby like a monster in the mist.  The
&+Lsense of being watched is unshakable, as if the stone itself has eyes which
&+Lfollow.  The ground here is naturally rough and covered with bits and pieces of
&+Wbone&+L and &+rflesh&+L.  The air here is very stale, almost in a disgusting manner.
&+LThere is a stench that seems to flow through the &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L caves without the
&+Lbenefit of air circulation.  The only heat in this dark region is that coming
&+Lfrom the &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L inhabitants and a few scattered naturally occuring vents.
&+LOne may travel futher in the &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L cave system by traveling west or south
&+Lfrom this point.&N

&+LA Secluded and Small &+gTr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L Cave&N~
&+L   This small cave is located deep in the &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L cave complex.  The air
&+Lis musty and stale here, as if a good deal of time has passed without fresh air
&+Lbeing introduced into the environment.  The cold stone does not hold heat very
&+Lwell, so the family of &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+Gs&+L nest is a very large pile of skins.  Small
&+Lscraps of food and feces lie near the caves entrance.  The cave ceiling is a
&+Lmere twelve feet from the cavern floor, providing a secluded and secure home
&+Ldwelling.  Small nooks and crannys have been carved into the cave wall and are
&+Lused for storage and organization of the families possessions.  This cave is
&+Lrather simple and unremarkable, but never the less, it is the only home of the
&+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L family the lives here.  One may travel east to leave this small
&+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L cavern.&N

&+LIn the Dark &+gTr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L Caves&N~
&+L   The dark &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte &+Lcaves continue to wind through the ground here.  The
&+Ltunnels have twisted and turned so many times up to this point in the tunnels
&+Lthe true direction is nearly impossible to discern.  There is nothing to make
&+Lany differentiation between this tunnel and any other tunnel within the cave
&+Lcomplex.  The dark stone is the same throughout the &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L caves, with no
&+Lvariances in the composition of the rock.  The air here is stagnant and has no
&+Lmovement what so ever.  The&+g tr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L people have claimed these naturally
&+Lformed caves as their own and have made some small adaptations to fully use the
&+Lentire complex to the fullest.  There is a small set of &+ciron&+L rungs embedded in
&+Lthe stone used as a means of getting from this level of the caves to the level
&+Lbelow it.  The rungs are sturdy and can support a good deal of weight.  One
&+Lmay travel south or down from this point in the troglodyte cave system.&N

&+LIn the Dark &+gTr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L Caves&N~
&+L   This oddly shaped room opens up in naturally formed cavern.  The cavern
&+Lroof is several yards above and is covered with small stalactites.  The south
&+Lwall is where the &+ciron&+L rung&+y ladder&+L is firmly attached.  The floor here is rough
&+Land uneven, sloping to the north, further into the &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L cave complex.
&+LThe naturally formed tunnels are a wild and, much to the chagrin of the brave
&+Ladventurer, deffinetly inhabited.  The stale air is filled with many scents,
&+Lmostly of rot and decay, of &+Glizards&+L and of &+Wd&+Le&+ra&+Lt&+Wh&+L.  The rough walls are filled
&+Lwith shadowy alcoves and hidden passages.  There are many passages that appear
&+Lto be tunnels, but most end in dead ends a few feet from this chamber.  The
&+Lfeeling of impending doom is unmistakable.  One may travel back up a level in
&+Lthe &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L caves or either north or east from this point.&N

&+LIn the Dark &+gTr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L Caves&N~
&+L   This narrow tunnel continues to wind through the cold stone of the large
&+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L cave complex.  The inhabitants of this dark cave system are a cold
&+Lblooded and ruthless people.  They are the stuff of legends, a powerful and
&+Lall together devestating race of warriors.  The air here is stale and never
&+Lchanging.  The cool stone walls are rough and uneven with several shadowy
&+Lalcoves visible from this immediate area.  The ceiling is quite askew, with a
&+Llong stone projection reaching from ceiling to floor.  The projection makes any
&+Ltravel nearly impossible through this narrow tunnel.  The &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L race is

&+LIn the Dark &+gTr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L Caves&N~
&+L   This dark tunnel continues to wind through the &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L cave complex.
&+LThe floor is rough and covered with small chips of stone.  The chips appear to
&+Lhave come from a recent leveling of the right hand wall.  The cold stone is
&+Lhard and unyielding, never changing, never evolving, always the exact same as
&+Lthe day before, the year before, the millenia before.  The air here is stale
&+Land quite unpleasant, filled with the scents of decay.  The &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L race is
&+Lfirmly entrenched in this cave complex, as at home here in the dark as any race
&+Lof elf is to nature.  The hard nature of the &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L race makes the life

&+LIn the Dark &+gTr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L Caves&N~
&+L   This narrow tunnel continues to wind through the &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L caves.  The
&+Lblack stone seems to be made of a granite like stone, the glassy surface able
&+Lto reflect light.  The entire cave complex of the &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+Gs&+L is devoid of any
&+Lnatural light.  The creatures themselves do not require light to see in these
&+Lcramped subterranean tunnels.  Small drops of moisture condense on the ceiling
&+Land drip from time to time, creating an odd echo in the endless night of this
&+Lcommunity.  The smell here is rather unpleasant for those unused to the smells
&+Lof death, decay, and sweating &+Greptiles&+L.  The walls here are very rough, still
&+Lin their natural condition.  A great deal of the &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L caves are in their
&+Lsame natural state, but there are some parts of the caves that did have to be
&+Lhand cut from the cold, black stone.  One may travel to the south or west from

&+LIn a Dark and Warm Hatching Nest in the &+gTr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L Caves&N~
&+L   This dark room is kept warm by the bodies of the &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+Gte&+L family that
&+Lmakes their home here.  The "nest" is actually a large pile of animal and also
&+Chuman&+L skin.  The hides are organized loosely but, together with the heat of the
&+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L bodies, it becomes quite cozy and warm.  The room is roughly in the
&+Lshape of a circle, the walls all the same distance from the center of the room.
&+LThis side cave is naturally formed with almost no stone work having been done.
&+LThe floor is littered with small&+W bones&+L and scraps of flesh.  Near the entrance
&+La large pile of molted &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L flesh has been piled as well.  One may travel

&+L   This rather large room is actually a naturally formed pocket in the deep
&+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L cave system.  The cavern is as large as a domed cathedral, the
&+Lceiling rising several hundred feet above the smooth cavern floor.  The walls
&+Lof this cavern are quite rough and uneven, with various small ledges criss-
&+Lcrossing the face of the walls.  The floor is comprised of a very rough black
&+Lrock, most likely some sort of lava based material.  The air here is putrid and
&+Lfilled with the disgusting smells of raw sewage.  There is a large moat like
&+Lhole near the wall to the north.  The hole in the floor is unprotected and
&+Lunguarded with any security railings or safety devices.  The hole is filled
&+Lwith&+b water&+L and filth, appearing to be some sort of &+Ylatrine&+L or sewage dump for
&+Lthe&+g tr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L peoples refuse.  One may travel down into the sludge or east

&+LIn the Dark &+gTr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L Caves Filled With &+BWater&N~
&+L   This tight passageway is filled with the filth and remains of the creatures
&+Lthat live in these caverns.  The&+B water&+L is murky and quite cold.  The&+B water&+L is
&+Lstagnant and does not move, allowing the filth and murk to settle to the bottom
&+Lof the passage.  The &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L people have no other way to dispose of their
&+Lwaste, so this passage is filled with their filth.  The tunnel is completely
&+Lfilled with the murky &+Bwater&+L, and no air is available above, below or on the
&+Lsides.  There are also &+Wbones&+L and&+W skulls&+L, some submerged in the filthy sediment
&+Lon the bottom, some floating, susupended in the liquid.  The walls here are
&+Lrough and uneven, but without any outlet or escape route for the&+B water&+L that

&+LIn the Dark &+gTr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L Caves Filled With &+BWater&N~
&+L    This section of the &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L caves is half filled with&+B water&+L.  The black
&+Bwater&+L is very near freezing temperature in a normal setting, but this far below
&+Lthe surface the &+Bwater&+L has different properties.  The amount of&+W salt&+L and mineral
&+Lcontent in the &+Bwater&+L makes its freezing point much lower than surface &+Bwater&+L.
&+LThe tunnel here is tight and hard to maneuver in, made even more difficult by
&+Lthe amount of &+Bwater&+L resting on the floor.  The air here is very cold and hard
&+Lto breath.  The&+B water &+Litself is very dirty, filled with the disgusting leavings
&+Lof the &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L people.  Essentially this &+Bwater&+L filled tunnel is one large,

&+L    The &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L caves continue here near the disgusting cess pool.  The
&+Gcess pool&+L is a water filled chamber filled with &+Bwater&+L and filth.  The ground
&+Lhere is damp and this landing above the&+G cess pool &+Lis prone to mildew.  The
&+Lceiling here rises high up, almost out of the range of normal vision.  The cave
&+Lceiling is covered with long and jagged stalactites, silent guardians ever
&+Lvigilant over the night that never ends.  This room is rather large and spreads
&+Lout to like an "L".  The northern wall is covered with various glyphs and crude
&+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L signs, written in their primative language.  The western wall is
&+Lrather plain, yet smooth, as if a stone mason worked hard to make the wall
&+Lcompletely flat.  A slight breeze seems to waft from the western wall, which is
&+Lodd since no holes or vents are visible.  To the east, a tight tunnel winds
&+Linto the stone, a side tunnel it would seem.  Below is the&+G cess pool&+L, a watery
&+Ltunnel leading back into the &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L cave complex.&N

&+LIn the Dark Hidden Passage of the &+gTr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L Caves&N~
&+L   This narrow landing is the beginning of a highly secret and closely
&+Lguarded area within the &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L cave complex.  The narrow stone platform is
&+Lnot a naturally formed prepice.  There is a long and winding set of stairs that
&+Lleads down into a lower level of the &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L cave complex connected to the
&+Llanding.  The air here is calm and undisturbed, smelling musty and stale.  The
&+Lceiling of this small room is many yards above, beyond the range of&+y torches&+L or
&+Lother forms of man-made light.  This room is the entrance to a highly guarded
&+Lseries of tunnels, although the immediate purpose is not readily evident.  The
&+Ltunnel here is not the naturally forming and twisting tunnels of the previous
&+Ltunnels in this system.  These walls are smooth and worked with fine masonry
&+Land stone working tools.  This is the entrance to the lowest layer of the cave
&+Lcomplex.  One may travel down further or east from this point.&N

&+LThe &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L caves are a harsh environment, filled with constant danger,
&+Limpending doom, and lurking evils.  The deadly creatures that live in these
&+Ldark tunnels are hunters of the night, and are quite proficient in warfare.
&+LThe tunnel floor is rough and uneven, littered with many small&+W bones&+L and pieces
&+Lof rotten flesh.  The walls here are filled with shadowy alcoves, providing
&+Lhiding and ambush places ideal for this dark cave system.  The &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L race
&+Lis a rare and infrequent visitor to the surface of this realm, yet those of the
&+Lsurface world are never seen this far into the &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L complex.  One may

&+Lthe warm light of the outside world.  The cold stone here is as black as a dark
&+Lnightmare.  The walls and floor have been slightly altered by the stone workers
&+Lto level out and smooth them.  The ceiling remains in its natural state with

&+Lwind through the cold stone.  The stone here seems to vibrate, almost hum as
&+Ldeep underground forces make such movement possible.  There are large cracks

&+Lof dust is visible in some of the holes.  There are several dark recesses in

&+Lis stale and not very fresh, but as compared to some of the previous tunnels
&+Ltoward the entrance of the cave, this &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L tunnel is a flowerbed.  The

&+Lnaturally forming currents of the surface.  The darkness is pervasive and feels

&+L   The dark and eerie &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L caves continue to wind through the dark
&+Lstone of the Black Dog mountains.  The air here seems to have an unshakable

&+Land cast ominous shadows, obvious danger regions and concealing hiding places.
&+LLong and jagged scars have been cut into the stone, most likely from a wicked
&+Lbattle.  The ceiling here is stained with a thick layer of soot from a long
&+Lsince extinguised &+Yf&+rir&+We&+L.  There is a sense here of being watched, as if perhaps
&+Lthe stone itself can hear and see invaders.  The cold stone of the &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L

&+LIn the Dark &+gTr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L Caves&N~
&+L   The caves continue here into the dark, unforgiving stone.  The air here is
&+Lmusty and unpleasant to breath.  Small traces of heat can be seen on the stone
&+Lfloor, slowly fading back to the cold emptiness of the dark.  The ground is
&+Lrough and uneven, but appears to be in better condition that most of the rest
&+Lof the &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L cave system.  The ceiling is cracked and crumbling, but the
&+Lrubble one would expect has been cleared away.  This tunnel seems to stretch
&+Lto the north, but the dark is so pervasive one cannot actually measure the true
&+Ldistance it goes back into the stone.  One may travel further into the cave
&+Lsystem to the north or back to the lower level by climbing down the stone steps
&+Lbelow.&N

&+LA Dark Storage Room in the &+gTr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L Caves&N~
&+L   This dark storage room is used to store whatever wares are acquired on
&+Lthe surface raids.  The&+g tr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+Gs&+L are often packrats, taking and storing
&+Lalmost anything.  This room is filled with boxes and barrels, all used to store
&+Lany goods they got back to their lair. The room smells bad because quite often
&+Lthe &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+Gs&+L forget about what they have amassed and it rots.  The floor is
&+Lcovered with scraps of food and various other trinkets.  No doors are needed in
&+Lthe clan because there is no way to really hide anything.  Everyone shares here
&+Lunless its something very nice.  In that case it would go to the chieftain.
&+LThere is usually someone here to make sure that everything is kept in order.
&+LOne may travel east to leave this dark storage room.&N

&+LApproaching the End of the &+gTr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L Caves&N~
&+L   The cave begins to grow very hot.  There are hundreds of small carvings
&+Lin the stone, all seeming to have magical qualities.  The stone walls are very
&+Lsmooth yet the floor remains very rough.  There is a huge set of stone doors to
&+Lthe north.  There is no light at all this deep into the earth.  This part of
&+Lthe caves is about as close to the center of the Black Dog Mountains as one can
&+Lget.  The cave is very stable but it is still very possible that an earthquake
&+Lcould cave this cave in.  There are small bones near the wall and they look
&+Lhumanoid.  The smell is very musky and the air feels damp.  There seems to be
&+La great deal of commotion going on nearby.  One may travel north or south from
&+Lthis point in the &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L caves.&N

&+LIn the &+gTr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte&+L Chieftains Throne Room.&N~
&+L   This room is the large throne room of the &+gtr&+Gog&+glo&+Gdy&+gte &+Lchieftain.  The room
&+Lis very dark, as is all the area here under the Black Dog Mountains.  The room
&+Lcan hold up to thirty people, but the chieftain is reputedly very paranoid and
&+Lwill seldom allows anyone of even his immediate family to enter.  There is a
&+Llarge yet simple throne here near the northern wall.  There are small rugs
&+Llocated in many places in the throne room that have piles of food or &+Mgems&+L on
&+Lthem.  The room smells very bad as &+gtr&+Gol&+gog&+Gdy&+gtes&+L don't value sanitation or other
&+Lforms of cleanliness.  This throne room is essentially a fortified barracks
&+Lwhere the chief can come for safety.  There are no side rooms which is rather
&+Lsurprising for a chief of this size of an underground clan.  It appears that
&+Lthere are plans to make a side room to the east as there is a small pile of
&+Ltools there.  There is a large door to the south to prevent unwanted visitors.

&NBeginning of a Narrow Mountain Pass&N~

are small &+Lrocks&N and&+L stones&N lying on the ground making this trail seem very
unused.  There are some small &+gshrubs&N dotting the landscape to your west and
east.  The path leads into some very tight rock formations that could make one
feel very claustrophobic.  Little wind comes to this very well protected area.
One may look back to the south and see the fields of the &+gfarming community of
&+gSalol&N.  The main trail leads to the north or south from this point.&N

after landslides or other natural phenomenon.  There is a few small weeds that
grow in a lower spot on the trail.  This trail continues onto the west and the

this edge.  The view us unbelieveable as one can gaze over the beautiful canyon
below.  The ledge is very small and precarious at only seven inches at its
widest.  The winds can freely whip and attack one as they try to make their way
down this narrow ledge.  The ledge continues onto the north and the trail goes

widens out to over five feet wide offering a very safe perch.  High above the
canyon below, you can see very far to the west.  There is a very high rock wall
looming to your north.  Several bird perches can be seen growing out of the
rock.  The small trees have amazingly found a home in the very sparse soil that
can be found in these high altitudes.  The rocky path continues on again to the

on the eastern wall that looks like it is almost alive.  The stone walls to the
east and south loom high above you blocking out much of the light.  There is a
sense of serenity on this trail as it seems to have not been touched by any
creature but the birds.  The rocky train continues to the north and the rocky

they offer little resistence to casual travelers.  There is a fair amount of
mud in the lower parts of the trail.  There are small holes in the sheer rock

making the narrow walkway even more perilous.  The rapids below in the canyon
roar with fury as they cut their path through the base of the mountains.  The

carefully traversed by the various hand holds that have been pounded into the
stone.  The metal hand holds have been carefully placed in order to best cross
the gap.  The ledge on either side of the gap is very narrow.  The barely two
inches offer little more than a toe hold.  The rock face to your south has very
rough and large stones jutting out and making traveling difficult.  The ledge

of room for your feet but the handholds here are more numerous.  Although the
hand holds offer some support it is still a very perilous situation.  The
cavern floor is several hundred feet below and it's all rock.  You can see
several vultures and other scavenger birds circling high above the cavern.  One
could wonder whether they are circling around someone who fell off or if they
are waiting for someone currently on the ledge.  The narrow walkway continues

chance for a new opportunity in &+LT&+Rentr&+Lo&N.  There are many buildings in the town,
all densely packed together.  The city is protected from the wild and deadly
creatures of the mountains by a huge city wall, constructed by a troupe of
highly skilled &+Ymountain dwarves&N.  The streets here are paved with smooth&+L stones&N
and&+L mortar&N, a combination that stands up to any weather condition.  There is
much to see and do in &+LT&+Rentr&+Lo&N such as:  attend the grand&+C cathedral&N, share a pint
in the large pub, browse rare and exotic goods in the merchants&+y tent&N, relax in
the&+r bath house&N of &+LT&+Rentr&+Lo&N, take the children to the &+yzoo &Nor even just watch the

unable to be swayed by relgious rhetoric.  There are still a good deal of
citizens that attend the&+C cathedral &Nregularly.  The structure itself is made

walkway was once used only in times of war to transport both troops and water
along the cities wall.  The troops were often quickly rushed to the eastern
walls where invasions were the most likely.  The&+B water&N was used when smarter
invaders would shoot&+r flaming &+yarrows&N over the wall and onto the &+ywooden&N buildings
causing a great deal of havoc and general danger to the citizens.  The road is
now used as any other road, for the transportation of goods and people.  The
road is partially paved, but, for the most part, it is just paved with various
cobblestones.  One may travel west to the central path or east along the wall
road.&N

this village is the way it brings people of all races together.  In the huge
&+Ccathedral&N to the south, many inter-racial marriages have taken place, with the
total blessing of the &+Wpriests&N there.  This village is founded on acceptance
and the goal of befriending all peoples.  The street here is paved with flat

and&+m flower &+Lbeds&N are well maintained and bright in color.  The stone pavement
is very well put together, no&+L cracks&N showing or &+Lholes&N are evident.  There are
many stone benches on both sides of the street, roughly every twenty feet.  A
large cleaning force must keep this place clean, by order of the mayor.  This
street is very well maintained.  One may travel to the west or east from this
point on the road.&N

Further Down the Side Street of &+YMatafana&N~
&N   The street is well maintained and bustles with activity.  There are large
buildings to both the north and south.  To the north is the&+R Battle&+Y Schools&N tall
and ominous&+L w&+wa&+Ll&+wl&+Ls&N.  The &+gtrees&N here are tall and offer much shade.  Several kids
run in and out of the rows of shade &+gtrees&N causing a great deal of excitement.
There are many small benches that line the street here.  This town is truly
geared to &+mtourism&N and entertaining visitors for there are many crappy shops on
either side of the road.  One may travel east or west.&N

End of the Street of &+YMatafana&N~
&N   This section of town marks the edge of the mountain village.  There are no
more houses or business to the west or north of here except for the world
famous oddity &+yzoo&N.  The&+y zoo &Nis located to the west and is a very popular place
to visit in &+LT&+Rentr&+Lo&N.  The street continues to the east and is named the street
of &+YMatafana&N.  The street travels east and west and is one of the busier roads
in the mountain village.  There is a &+Ldark&N and tight &+Lalley&N located to the south
that squeezes between the village wall and the stone buildings.  There are many
strange smells combining here from the &+yzoo &Nand the &+Ldark alleyway&N.  One may

&+LA Dark and Smelly Back Alley&N~
&+L   This dark alleyway is located behind the large and splendid &+Ccathedral&+L of
&+LT&+Rentr&+Lo.  The riches and valuables contained in the church could easily feed
&+Lall of the homeless of this village, but life isn't exactly fair.  Many bums
&+Land vagrants hang out here in the shadow of the House of God.  There are many
&+Lstacks of old newspapers and worn out hymnals here on the moist ground.  Many
&+Lof the younger priests of the &+Ccathedral&+L will come here secretly to preach the
&+Lword of God to the homeless.  One may travel north or south in this back alley.

&+LDark Passageway Behind A Large Building&N~
&+L   This dark alleyway is a good place to hide from the bustle of the village.
&+LThere are many nooks and crannies where one might squeeze in to hide.  The
&+Lalleyway is about four feet wide and therefore very hard to walk in anything
&+Lbut a straight line.  There is some assorted garbage and scraps lying on the
&+Lground, either blown in by the wind or discarded by some careless citizen.  The
&+Lalleyway is filled with many unpleasant smells of rot and decay.  The stone
&+Lbuildings to the east loom high above the narrow passage.  One may travel to
&+Lthe north or south from this point.&N

Inside the &+CHoly Cathedral&N of the Gods&N~
&N   This large building houses the only clerical faction in the city of&+L T&+Rentr&+Lo&N.
The people of&+L T&+Rentr&+Lo&N often will come to this place just to gaze upon the great
mosaics and statues, all wonderful works of art.  There are many pews and other
forms of benches lined up.  It seems that the church has been recently cleaned
as it smells like incense and soap-suds.  The light shines through the many
large windows located on either side of the &+Cchurch&N.  In the ceiling is a large
sky-light with a huge cross.  The light casts a huge cross over the entire
building, ending near the front of the church where the altar and lecturn are
located.  The floor is made from tighly fit &+Lstones&N, fit perfectly together
without the use of mortar.  There is much to see in such a grand building.  One
may travel south or west in the &+Ccathedral&N, or east out through the &+ydouble doors&N
to get back onto the street.&N

excellent condition.  There is a good deal of pride put into this road, as it
is one of the more important roads in the city.  The street is paved with dark
&+Lstones&N, in many places designed into impressive mosaics.  There are no &+gweeds&N
growing up through the &+Lstone&N surface of the street, they appear to be pulled on
a regular basis.  There are a few buildings located in this part of town, but
the bigger buildings seem to be located to the south east.  One may travel to

travelers from afar can meet together and talk.  There is a wealth of gossip
and other forms of &+Winformation&N here.  This is the center of entertainment for
people at night.  One may exit by traveling west or continue in the bar to the

reflective mirror that has been mounted on the wall with some long nails. There

is a small orchard of &+mplum&+g trees&N here.  They were planted when the original
settlement moved into &+LT&+Rentr&+Lo&N.  The &+mplums &Nare considered public domain and all
that wish to eat them may whenever they want.  There are specific laws in the
city that prevent anyone from harvesting or selling the&+m plums&N for profit.
There are a few &+ywooden benches&N located near the &+gtrees&N for people to sit and
enjoy the fruit.  One may travel north or south from this point.&N

The Southern Walk of &+LT&+Rentr&+Lo&N~
&N   The southern walk of &+LT&+Rentr&+Lo&N is a very boring place.  There are no buildings
to speak of located here, just a loose assortment of shantys and of course the
southern wall of &+LT&+Rentr&+Lo&N, a large and sturdy means of protection for the city.
The street itself is paved, but not well maintained.  There are many large
cracks and pieces of the pavement that have been removed completely.  The wall
casts its long&+L shadow &Nover this stret the majority of the time.  Small tufts
of &+ggrass&N grow near the structure to the north.  One may travel to the east or
south on the southern walk of &+LT&+Rentr&+Lo.&N

&+LT&+Rentr&+Lo&N's Southern Walkway&N~
&N   The southern road continues here as it travels along the city wall.  The
road is covered with various forms of&+L trash&N, some of which appear to have been
sitting here in the elements for months.  There are some tall tufts of&+g weeds&N
that grow near to the wall.  Due to the fact there are so many buildings to
the north, this road is generally &+ccool&N and protected from the beating power of
the&+Y sun&N.  The road is generally full of traders and merchants, but as of late
the amount of new trade that comes in is nearly non-existant.  One may travel
west or east from this point.&N

A Four-Way Intersection on &+GGreen Plum Avenue&N~
&N   &+gGreen Plum Avenue&N meets two other streets at this intersection:  The
southern walk of&+L T&+Rentr&+Lo&N and &+mAll Saints Boulevard&N.  This large square formed by
the converging streets is a popular place for people to hang out in.  There
are many &+ybenches&N one may rest and converse on.  Large buildings loom in three
directions and the city wall rises to the southwest, the best protection one
can have from the savage forces located outside of &+LT&+Rentr&+Lo&N.  Many strange smells
come from a nearby food vendor.  Many scholars claim that the original wall
that surrounded&+L T&+Rentr&+Lo&N was located here, the part of the village to the south
was located outside of the protective wall.  That ancient wall has been long
gone and the nice intersection remains.  One may travel in any direction.&N

and plush &+Mcouches&N on each wall with a receptionists &+ydesk&N in the middle of the
room in front of the southern door.  There are several small desks that are
located between the various couches.   The smells here are quite pleasant with
two different incense burners on each table.  There is a large book case filled
with different annals and journals on the western wall.  The large &+rred&N carpet
has been carefully cleaned.  The mayors personal office is located to the south
and the street is located to the east.&N

and important &+mdignitaries&N.  The room is quite large with a domed ceiling.  The
dome has a glass center which allows this room to be &+Willuminated&N by the light
of day.  There are also some &+Loil lamps&N hanging at intervals that can be lit to
allow the mayor to continue his business into the night.  The mayor has a large
&+yoak desk&N that has been polished to a high gloss shine.  There are three large
and soft looking chairs positioned in front of the desk.  There are many books
and rolled up parchments in a &+ybookcase&N on the western wall.  The mayors office
is a very nice place to rest and chat with the mayor himself.  On the walls
there are several strange masks.  The exit to the room is located to the north.&N

is adorned with many statues and ornamental decorations.  The bank has a large
sign that is plated with tempered copper.  The sign reflects golden light on
the street during the day, a superstition of luck assosiated with it.  There is
also a modest garden in front of the bank, a well maintained and interesting
arrangement.  One may enter the bank to the east or travel north and south on

Along the Village Wall on &+gGreen Plum Avenue&N~
&N   The curving nature of &+LT&+Rentr&+Los&N protective wall had a great effect on the
layout of the cities streets.  The city wall is located to the west, which some
might find odd since this is the eastern part of town.  The&+g grass&N is cut short
here, a great deal of care taken to ensure the&+g grass&N remains healthy.  There
are some large&+L stone benches&N that look like they could hold fifteen people.  A
sense of culture is evident here, many statues and mosaics on each building.

&N   The grandly decorated&+g Green Plum Avenue&N ends here.  The nicely made road
meets up with one of the less grandly engineered roads here, one of the many
roads that run parallel to the village wall.  The road that travels east from
here is not used in any purpose besides in times of seige and in the moving of
goods on a day to day basis.  The small side roads are often the fastest for
moving goods because they are not congested with the heavy traffic as in the
larger and more popular roads.  The village wall looms high above ones head
here, casting an ominous, yet reassuring shadow.  One may travel north or east
depending on ones destination.&N

&+mThe Beginning of All Saints Boulevard&N~
&N   &+mAll Saints Boulevard&N was first called that because of the tendancy of the
&+Wholy priests&N from the &+Ccathedral&N was to come to this small side street and bear
witness to those who had not yet met their God.  The extensive preaching that
the &+Wpriests&N did led many of the citizens of this village out of the&+L darkness&N
they once felt and gave them &+Chope&N.  The street has been very meticulously
cleaned by the younger members of the &+Wchurch&N as a display of respect for the
long passed-away &+Wpriests&N.  There are many nice shade &+gtrees&N and benches that
make this place very nice to walk around in.  One may travel east or west.&N

at any time of the day.  Any&+g grasses&N growing here have been trampled by the

to keep &+LT&+Rentr&+Lo&N a free and safe haven for those in need.  There are no permanent
&+ywooden&N buildings here, only&+L stone&N, to prevent any&+r fires&N from breaking out this

A Tight Alley Near the Village Wall&N~
&N   This side street has no practical purpose.  The only real reason this side
path is here is because the builders of the stone buildings to the north didn't
choose to build their structures right up against the village wall.  The street
is relatively clear of and debris or filth of any kind.  There are many strange
symbols carved into the wall, more than likely a crude monument used to tell
the history of this mountain town.  It has fallen into decay as of late and
some parts are very difficult to decipher.  There are only two directions to
travel forth from this point, east or west.&N

stone buildings to the north.  The street is relatively clean and well taken
care of by the village maintenance crews.  There are little pieces of&+g grass&N
growing through the pavement, somehow finding a place to grow.  There are some
look-out positions on the wall, used for scanning the horizon for trouble.
The wall is very important for the village because at night, it is rumored that
raiding bands of &+ggoblins&N can often sweep into a village and destroy it in a
matter of hours.  One may travel east or west.&N

large village wall looms high above the street here, keeping the ruffians out
of the village.   For many generations this wall has been manned by the ever
vigilant villagers who have volunteered to serve their community.  More often
than not the heads of the houses pick their younger sons or eldest daughters
for the watch, not out of spite, but as a manner of pride.  Civil servants are
often held with the highest of esteem amongst the peoples of &+LT&+Rentr&+Lo&N.  The night
watchers are in particular the some of the most appreciated and looked up to
people in the entire village.  One may travel up to a guards post, or north or
west on the village roads.&N

Traveling Along &+WLongbow Avenue&N~

the location to the city wall, this street is generally kept free of excessive
traffic.  The wall itself looms high over the street, a powerful form of safety
and protection from any invading forces.  The street here is paved with&+L stones&N,
much like the rest of town, but here the&+L stones&N have been covered with a thick
coating, making the street feel smooth.  There are no real residential houses
in this part of town, only the market and the&+r bath house&N.  One may travel to
the north or south from this point.&N

modern religions, yet this building has been kept and maintained anyhow.  The
ladies of the village are often seen here haggling with the caretakers for a
lower price on the many exotic&+g plants &Nthat grow here.  The &+ggreenhouse&N is no

&N   &+WLongbow Avenue&N is so named for the many guard positions on the eastern wall.
This side of the village is the most heavily defended because of all the many
wild creatures and civilizations located in the mountains.  The city wall is
tall and bleached &+Wwhite&N.  The street itself is paved with&+y brown brick&N and lined
with many different types of small&+g shrubs&N.  There are some very nice looking
buildings to the west, many of which have stood for several decades.  This
street is one of the furthest from the center of the village, but also one of
the most often visited by outsiders.  One may travel north or south.&N

Inside the Merchants Tent&N~
&N   The many sights and sounds of this &+Mmarket&+r place&N almost cause a sensory
overload.  There are many people bustling about the market, often bartering and
arguing in equal amounts.  There are a lot of different kinds of people selling
their wares in the large tent.  The tent itself is a large structure that was
meant to be temporary when it was first erected.  The many &+ywooden&N booths that
have been built here have made the structure both more permanant and more
sturdy.  The crowd here isn't very thick and stifling as it appears to be an
off time for the market.  One may exit the market to the street by traveling
north.  The market continues to west and south.&N

Amongst the Many Vendors in the Merchants Tent&N~
&N   Many vendors sell there wares in this northwestern corner of the tent.  The
tent smells of sweat and &+gc&+ya&+gb&+yb&+ga&+yg&+ge&N, an altogether unappealing combination.  There
are many people here trying to snatch up some good deals before they are lost
forever. There are many &+ywooden booths &Nhere, all full of both rare and common
goods, sold by ruffians and wealthy merchants alike.  The sand here is dusty
and very fine, often getting in the customers sandals or shoes.  There is a
great drone that is the constant shouting that goes on while the haggling takes
place.  One may travel east or south in the market.&N

Inside of the Large Merchants Tent&N~
&N   The merchants tent is very busy during all times of the day.  The tent is
well put together, almost a permanent fixture on the streets of &+LT&+Rentr&+Lo&N.  The
ground here was once &+ggrass&N, but has been trampled flat and dead by the many
crowds this tent attracts.  The smell in here can be very bad when the &+Cf&+Li&+Cs&+Lh&N
merchants bring their goods in or could be very pleasant when the&+L in&+ycen&+Lse&N
merchants make the journey from far away.  There are many &+ywooden booths&N around
the tent.  One may travel to the north or east from this point.&N

Wandering Through the Many Vendors in the Merchants&+y Tent&N~
&N   The sheer amount of vendors in the merchant&+y tent&N is overwhelming.  There are
many merchants that have come from many days away just to sell their wares here
in &+LT&+Rentr&+Lo&N for one day.  The&+y booths&N are very tightly packed together here making
it difficult to shop in comfort.  The ground is &+Lmuddy &Nand full of puddles
because of the many fish vendors here.  There are many interesting&+y booths&N here
that sell rare and remarkable foods from distant lands.  One may travel to the
north or west from this point.&N

&NThe Entrance to the &+LT&+Rentr&+Lo&N &+rBath House&N~
&N   The entrance of this large building is filled with exotic sights and smells.
There are many grandly crafted sculptures and&+y furniture&N here making this area
of the&+r bath house&N very pleasant to sit and rest in.  The tile on the floor is
very smooth and glassy to the touch.  There are many naked people walking
around.  They are either showing off their bodies or trying to get a new
customer for that oldest of trades.  The&+L m&+Wa&+Lr&+Wb&+Ll&+We&N door way has been constructed
quite well making this place appear all the grander.  The warm baths can be
accessed here as well.  The warm &+bwater&N fills most of this large domed building.
There are some meticulously crafted&+Y can&+Ldel&+Yabr&+Las&N on each side of the entry way
that give this building a touch of class.  One may go north or west into the
warm &+bwater&N or east back onto the street.&N

bubbles and churns, powered by underwater jets.  The bath deck is covered with

&N   The warm&+b waters&N of the &+rbath house&N are filled with the many patrons of the
popular bathing area.  The &+bwater&N has been kept relatively clean and has been
routinely filtered with large nets to fish out any hair or other bodily wastes.
The &+Ls&+Wt&+Lo&+Wn&+Le &+Ww&+La&+Wl&+Ll&+Ws&N of the building itself are covered with hundreds and thousands
of tiny carvings or mosaics.  The large dome ceiling above illuminates the
large structure perfectly except for, or course,&+L cl&+Wou&+Ldy&N days.  For days such
as those large&+y torches&N are lit by the villages workers.  The &+bwater&N is very nice

The Deep End of the &+LT&+Rentr&+Lo&N &+rBath House&N~
&N    The area of the &+rbath house&N is actually in the warm &+bwater&N.  The &+bwater&N is
quite deep, about five feet and many people actually swim at this end.  There
are many small &+Lstatues&N that line the&+b pool&N on a small ledge ten feet above the
&+bwaters&N surface.  There is a walkway that forms the border between the&+b pool&N and
the stone walls of the &+rbath house&N.  The domed ceiling of the structure is many
feet above the surface and lets a great deal of light into the building.  There
are many people in the bath &+cgossiping&N, swimming or just enjoying ths sights.
There is a &+Ls&+Wt&+Lo&+Wn&+Le&N ramp that can be used to get out of the &+bwater&N to the south.
One may swim in the &+bwater&N to the west.&N

&+b   There is much to see here below the surface of the water.  Many legs and
&+bbottoms are clearly visible here, a perfect hideout for a pervert.  One can see
&+bmany assorted items that have fallen onto the floor of the pool.  They range
&+bfrom things like hair brushes, silver coins, bits of hair, even some chicken
&+bbones that were carelessly dropped into the water.  The stone floor is smooth
&+band hold the water perfectly.  There is however a stone slab that seems to be
&+bout of place.  There appears to be a good handhold on it.  Perhaps it leads to
&+bthe maintenance tunnels or something.  The stone walls of the bathing facility
&+bare more than three centuries old, but they have been maintained in a manner to
&+bkeep them looking, and functioning, like new.  One may travel east or south

&+bcreated by a very skilled artist.  The walls of the pool are also tiled but

&+bmany small passageways going away from here at seemingly random directions.
&+bThere are only three passages big enough for your size however.  The darkness

enough to hold a small gathering.  There is a large iron&+L urn&N in the center of
the room that is used to burn &+yincense&N.  The walls are made of stone and are

&+yTo the north is a small wooden building that is more than likely used as the

&+g   This grassy plain seems to go on forever.  To the north the plain seems
&+gto dip down into a depression, a bowl shaped area.  The region is normally
&+gfilled with wild animals, from &+ybuffalo &+gto &+Wwild horses&+g.  Most animals stay clear
&+gof the city of &+LT&+Rentr&+Lo &+gfor fear of being hunted.  Most people from Tentro do not
&+gthemselves hunt, but travelers and explorers often will leave the safety of the
&+gcity walls for the thrill of the hunt.  The city wall is still visible from
&+ghere, a large and impressive structure.  No trees grow on this vast prairie,
&+gthe sod is too thick to let any new plants come in.  There are some thin trails
&+gleading to the north.  One may travel to the north or west from this point.&N

&+gA &+LDirt&+y Road&+g Leading to Some Fertile Farmland&N~
&+g   There is a &+Ldirt&+y road&+g winding through some tall grasses.  The path is
&+grather wide and has two deep ruts left from wagon wheels.  There are many
&+gacres of farmland spreading out in every direction.  One can see farm houses
&+gand smoke wafting from their chimneys.  Some animals can bee seen milling
&+gabout the fields.  There are several colors on the horizon as the sun goes

&+gOn the Long and &+LDirt&+y Road&+g Through the Fertile Fields&N~
&+g   This road continues in a rather straight direction through many different
&+gtypes of crop fields.  The road is wide but not really useful to the farmers,
&+gwho tend to not use it.  The road is most utilized by traveling merchants that
&+gtrade with the farming community.  There are few stones or pebbles on the road
&+gfor the village children throw them for fun.  The road is often muddy after a
&+gheavy rain, but it appears to be solid now.  One may travel west or east.&N

&+gThe &+LDirt&+y Road&+g Leading to a Farming Community&N~
&+g   This farming community is surrounded by hundreds of acres of fertile land.
&+gThere are few trees around the village of Salol because the people have tried
&+gto remove as much of the land encumbering trees to get the optimum amount of
&+Ltopsoil&+g for the fields.  The few trees that do remain are usually alone or in
&+ggroups of three, more for asthetic beauty than anything.  The &+Ldirt&+g path is
&+goften muddy in rainy weather, but is rather dusty at the moment.  One can see
&+gmany small farmhouses in the distance.  The smells of this region are both
&+gsweet and earthy.  One may travel west or east.&N

&+gA Turn on the Main Path of Salol&N~
&+g   This farming community was once a very large and prosperous town on the
&+gfrontier of the civilized world.  The world caught up quickly and now this
&+gfarmland is now in almost the center of the known world.  It is very safe and
&+gis not guarded what-so-ever from invasion and raids.  The village itself was
&+goriginally settled by the humans who lived in the large city of Darngor.  They
&+gtraveled quite a great distance to settle here and live off the land.  There
&+gare many types of crops grown in the fields to the north.  One may travel north

&+gApproaching the Farming Community of Salol&N~
&+g   The farms and fields of the village of Salol are reknown for their high
&+gcrop output.  The vegetables grown here are quite spectacular and sought after
&+gby the cooks and chefs of Duris's grandest cities.  The ground around here
&+gis covered with lush, green grass.  The road rises above the surrounding ground
&+gand forms both a dike during high water and a relatevely dry roadway.  The road
&+gis most used by traveling merchants and the farmers who leave the area to sell
&+gtheir goods in the more populated trading regions.  One may travel north or

&+gmaintained by the villagers of Salol.  There are many interesting concepts used
&+gby the farmers to irrigate and weed their crops.  This farming community is
&+gquite advanced technologically.  One can see many farmers and animals milling
&+gabout the surrounding country side.  The dirt path below is raked two times a

&+gThe Crossing of Many Paths in Salol&N~
&+g   Several paths meet here.  This large crossing is one of the busiest
&+gnon-paved intersections in the entire world.  The &+Ldirt &+yroads&+g that meet here
&+gare used by both farmers and merchants.  The farmers use the road to travel
&+gfrom field to field.  The merchants use the road to both enter the farming
&+gcommunity and to haul the many foodwares out of Salol to the larger trading
&+gcommunities.  The intersection is almost always clogged with traffic as
&+gthere is no way of regulating the many large&+G produce &+gcarts.  Many fields can
&+gbe seen off in the distance, as well as some assorted village homes.  One
&+gmay travel north on the main path of Salol or south out of the farming
&+gcommunity.  There are also some small&+L dirt &+yroads&+g that circumvent the many
&+gfields that go east and west.&N

&+gOn the Wide &+LDirt&+y Path&+g Around the Fields&N~
&+g   This path is located around the circumference of the village of Salol.
&+gThe wide road is comprised of a mixture of soil and coarse gravel, making for
&+ga somewhat stable road material.  There are many gates and fences wired up
&+gbetween large&+y wooden fence posts&+g visible on both sides of the road.  The many
&+gfences are used more often for the hearding of livestock down the road than
&+gfor keeping things in the fields.  The ditches here aren't very deep but are
&+gusually wet from the average percipitation that falls.  To the north and east

&+g   This side path travels around the community of Salol.  There are a few
&+gsmall homes and huts here, but for the most part, those are located further
&+gnorth.  The majority of the land in this southern portion of the community are
&+gused for the community fields.  The people of Salol always work together in
&+gtheir fields.  The health of the village has been maintained due to the fact
&+gthat they trade with the larger cities nearby and share the profits with each
&+gother.  Several times the village has been threatened by evil enemies, but each
&+gand every time, its allies, such as Woodseer or &+LT&+Rentr&+Lo&+g, have came to its aid
&+gto protect it.  The produce from this village is as important as the iron ore
&+gfrom the mountain ranges of the east.  One may travel to the north or to the

&+ghorses in the various fields here, for the people of Salol always keep busy.
&+gQuite often the men will stay up well into the night, working by moonlight
&+gwhen they can, by lantern on overcast nights.  There is a good deal of friendly
&+gand pleasant fellowships between the men, and even more so between the women.
&+gA great deal of profit has came to these people just due to the fact that they

&+gthe more important crops grown here for it is used in so many ways.  The&+Y corn&+g
&+gplants grow high over the five foot fences built around the field.  Their many
&+gears push out from the protection of the leaves, just begging to be picked.
&+gThe road here has been recently smoothed and packed down by the villagers in
&+gan attempt to keep it in top condition.  The grass shoulders on either side are
&+gprime locations to take an afternoon nap.  The ditches are relatively dry for

&+gpath continues here, meandering its way north, turning lazily through the farm
&+glands.  This region is peaceful and is ruled democratically, with no real
&+gchosen leader.  Elders make up a good deal of proposals and control the general
&+gway life evolves, but even they are wise enough to listen to all.  The ditches

&+gcommunity is very peaceful this day.  The work has been done and now the people
&+gare relaxing.  Still, some of the most dedicated people continue to find some
&+gwork to do.  More likely than not they are bored.  The road is hard packed and
&+ggreat for travel.  The ditches on either side are full of tall grass for this

&+gA Turn on the Wide &+LDirt&+y Path&+g of Salol&N~

&+gcommunity has prospered due to advanced farming techniques and the relative
&+gsafety given to them by their location.  There are few wandering bands of &+Lorc&+g
&+gor goblins to attack and plunder the land.  Few of the farmers have actually
&+grecieved any training to fight back if encountered with an aggressive opponent.
&+gThe road has been well made and only has to be maintained once a year in order
&+gto fill in the holes left by the receding frost.  Many acres of farmland are
&+gvisible in any direction.  This farming community grows many crops and is very
&+gimportant to the surrounding cities.&N

&+gA Bend in the Central Path of the Farming Fields&N~
&+g   The road bends here as it travels around the circumference of the large
&+gcommunity field.  The roads, much as the fields themselves, are maintained by
&+gthe community as one.  The result is surprising to outsiders, nice roads all
&+gthe time.  The people of Salol are not lazy and maintain their roads once every
&+gtwo weeks to ensure that they stay firm and useable.  When the rains come hard
&+gand fast, the roads often will become unpassable, but in a few days, the people
&+gof Salol will almost always have them back up to their former state.  Large
&+gditches are on either side of the road, used for both drainage and irrigation.
&+gA good deal of traffic passes on this road each and every day.  One may travel
&+gto the east or north from this point.&N

&+g   Two roads come together here in front of the fence of the&+W potato&+g field.
&+gThe roads are currently quite muddy and in poor conditions from heavy use.  The
&+Wpotato&+g harvest is in full swing and the sheer workload put on the dirt roads
&+gis enough to damage their integrity.  Thick grasses grow near the fences as it
&+gis impossible to cut or use such grasses.  The fence to the north is built of
&+ywooden posts &+gand thin cross-pieces, not enough to keep any large farm animals
&+gout if they really wanted to get through.  A thin piece of wire keeps the
&+ygate&+g closed.  One may travel into the field by going north or to travel on the

&+gThe Entrance to a Large &+YCorn&+g Field&N~

&+gfor the village of Salol.  The citizens of Salol have decided to work as a
&+gcommunity on their fields, instead of farming individual plots of land.  This
&+gtype of agricultural coexistence benefits the community and not the individual.
&+gEveryone prospers when the fields prosper.  The&+Y corn &+ggrows in long and straight
&+grows, providing the most ideal growing conditions.  There is a&+y wooden fence

&+Ycorn&+g field because of both the fact that its located in the more open areas
&+gand the fact that the ground is lower here.  Over half of the plants were
&+gdrown out in the germanation period.  The&+Y corn&+g that does grow looks scrawny
&+gand under-nourished.  One may travel north or east.&N

&+gInside the Large &+YCorn&+g Field in the Farming Community of Salol&N~
&+g   This large &+Ycorn&+g field is used to grow &+Ycorn &+gwhich is used in making many
&+gother products.  The &+Ycorn&+g is used in various alcohols and is often ground into
&+gfine flour for baking purposes.  The&+L soil&+g here is kept damp in order to keep
&+gthe corn well supplied with moisture.  &+YCorn &+gplants surround this point of the
&+gfield making it nearly impossible for the normal sized person to see the homes
&+gor surrounding roads.  Small game trails weave in and out of the rows of&+Y corn&+g.
&+gOne may travel east, north or south from this point in the &+Ycorn&+g field.&N

&+gof soil in the entire farming community of Salol.  The tall&+Y corn&+g grows to a
&+gheight of up to ten feet tall, quickly outgrowing any weeds that may grow along
&+gwith the &+Ycorn &+gplants.  The dirt is not dry for the precipitation has kept it

&+gThe &+LDirt&+y Road &+gThrough the Fields&N~
&+g   The nature of the location of the fields here in Salol makes it impossible
&+gto have any straight roads.  This road is no exception as it twists and turns
&+gthrough the large planting plots, fertile regions where the crops have been
&+gput into the ground.  There are fences on either side of the road from the
&+gindividual fields, a weak form of protection from the large and clumsy farm
&+ganimals.  The middle of the road is covered in grass, the rest of the road is
&+gmud, places where the grasses have been worn away by the&+y wooden carts&+g used to
&+gmove goods around the community.  One may travel to the north or west from this

&+gpiece of cut up&+W potatoes &+gthat eventually grow into a healthy plant.  &+WPotatoes&+g
&+ghave lots of different applications on the dinner table.  They can be used as

&+gIn Salols Large &+WPotato&+g Fields&N~
&+g   This large field is used to grow the very important&+W potato &+gplants.  The
&+gplant is very important to the farmers and the surrounding communities.  In
&+gyears where famine or general crop diseases eliminate all the crops that grow
&+gabove ground, the&+W potato&+g is often the only food source for the people.  The
&+gfarmers who live here use a great deal of food scraps left over from the&+W potato&N
&+gplant.  They feed the greens to the cattle and the roots to the pigs that they
&+graise.  The ground here is very fertile and provides almost ideal growing
&+gconditions for the &+Wpotato&+g.  There are often farmers working here pulling of
&+gthe bugs that are a constant problem for the plants.  There is also small piles
&+gof weeds that have been recently removed.  One may travel in any direction from

&+gpossible.  The air is fresh and clean here amongst the many rows of&+W potatoes&+g.
&+gFew bugs or insects of any kind are even in this area.  The entire village of
&+gSalol is a relatively safe place to raise a family.  There are often days when

&+gA Turn on The Field Road&N~
&+g   The field road continues to wind around the many fields and homes of the
&+gfarming community.  There are many dogs in this community, after all they are
&+gmans best friend.  The dogs were originally used as work animals until the
&+gfarmers were introduced to the sturdy work horses they now use by some wayward
&+gtravelers.  The farmers were at first scared and in awe, but quickly adapted
&+gto use the strong animals to their fullest advantage.  From this point one can
&+gsee the grand importance of these creatures.  The field to the south has been
&+grecently plowed by a team of horses, a feat that would have taken days by a
&+gteam of dogs, the horses completed the task in a few hours.  One may travel
&+gwest or north from this point.&N
