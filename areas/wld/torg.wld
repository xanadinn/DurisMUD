&+yA Thin Trail Winding Up the Mountain&n~
&+y   A thin animal trail seems to wind here.  It is barely visible and has been
&+ybeaten down by animal tracks alone.  The thickets to either side make sight
&+yimpossible further into the deep woods.  &+yFor a forest it is entirely too
&+ysilent.  Where birds should be chirping and squirrels chittering happily a
&+ydeathly silence permeates the silence left by the absentee happy animals.&N
&+yFurther to the north the trail winds around narrow and imposing.&N

&+BCentral Aisle In Torg's Outer Compound&n~
&+B   This is the central aisle in the Outer Compound of Torg.  Guards bustle in&n
&+Band out of every area but there is an order to it all.  Up ahead an area is set&n
&+Baside for a monitor to decide who shall go on and who shall not.  For such a&n
&+Bmighty empire one might expect gold and inlaid jewels everywhere but such is&n
&+Bnot the case.  The military style of building and decore stays true even in the&n
&+Bheadquarters building itself.  Utility is paramount for this area of soldier&n
&+Bpeople.&N

An Underground Pit Built For The Monitor's Pet~
&N   This dank pit was designed especially for the monitor.  Long has he been a
valued servant of Torg and his pet is renowned for its ferociousness.  Unable
to keep such a monster next to him for fear that it might eat an ogre emissary
Torg keeps hispet down here.  Should ever the need come the monitor may summon
his beast.  Examining the dank cellar it makes the hairs on the back of your
neck stand up.  The stench of death and decay is enough to turn the strongest
man's stomach.&N

&+yThe Path Comes To A Halt AT Pile Of Rocks&n~
&+y    The beaten path seems to come to a halt around the &+Lpile of rocks&+y here.
&+yIn a circle about the &+Lpile&+y tracks have beaten the grass to dirt leaving
&+yscattered and indeed random tracks everywhere.  Intermixed with the deer some
&+yhumanoid tracks seem to be there as well as marks indicating something heavy
&+yhaving been dragged to the rocks.  Small spots of &+rblood&+y are indeed visible

&+Lis but a small gate with a single guard.  From this entrance, small raids can&n
&+Lleave and bring back their new slaves for the mines.  The gate to the east&n
&+Lseems to be mainly unused.  Strangely you notice that the mine entrance,&n
&+Land further down the mine itself, are held up by straight &+ywooden&+L beams.  In&n
&+Lany emergency situation, this side gate and the mines themselves can be&n
&+Ldestroyed instantly by a switch which lights fire to the beams and destroys&n
&+Lthem.  Thus the main gate becomes the only entrance.    &n

&n   Even knowing that many of their kind serve inside the city, the &+Lorc&n
mines are the ideal place to serve.  The guard duty here mainly involves
portioning the extra shares for the good service of the &+Lorcs&n out.  The
problem however comes from the fact that, though they be captives of war no
abuse of these prisoners is possible.  They are a valuable asset being the
hardest working, so watching the &+Lobsidian slab&n is boring at best.

The Barracks~
&n   These large barracks house all the guards for the mining complex.  However
it seems that usually only the larger guards get any sleep whatsoever.  If you
are not a burly &+ghobgoblin&n in these jobs, you are but a step above the slaves
themselves.  The beds are rough stray mattresses covered with &+yburlap&n blankets.
Even the large &+ghobgoblins&n are afforded no luxuries. &n

&+ymake sight impossible further into the deep woods.  Here the trees begin to
&+ythicken once again.  Soon vision once again is limited to approximately
&+ytwenty five feet into the wood.  Shadows seem to darken the path almost fully
&+yhere and the heigtened intensity can once again be felt fully.  The silence

&+LAn Enourmous Cave Leads Into The Depths&n~
&n   This enormous &+Lcave&n leads down into the darkness of an underworld below.
Surpisingly the cave sides are &+Wsmooth&n and appear to have been worn down from
use.  In fact this surprising cave is wide enough that a fully laden &+ywagon&n
loaded with supplies could easily fit both vertically and horizontally. The
&+Lgrey rock&n of the upper cave begins to fade into a darker more &+Lobsidian&n

A Slowly Slanting Wide Cave Leads Further Down~
&N   Slowly the cave begins to &+Ldarken&n more.  As this stone pathway leads
underground one might think that the walls would narrow some.  Such is not the
case and if anything they widen a bit.  Along the corners of the cave pathway
are bits of disgusting carrion.  A guess might be that at some point a &+rbloody
&+rbattle&n occured just recently.  Further examination indeed does reveal small
bits of &+Rintestine&n and &+Rgut&n still slightly moist, beginning to rot.&n

stacked &+rb&+Wa&+rr&+Ws&n of rank on their breasts.  Even the &+gchildren&n themselves are given

walls of this underground thoroughfare are lined with stalls and hawkers and
brimming with military people.  In this underworld community all is kept in
strict order.  The construction of this city indeed was well thought out for
defensive purposes.  At every fifty feet a new archers alcove or small set of
battlements can be seen set into the rock face of the cavern.  It might indeed
take an invading army a long time to make their way to the palace through a
retreating action.&N

are traded.  Now while this may be fear of one another, most likely it is for
fear of the numerous &+ghobgoblin&n guards striding through the crowd.  When
a fight or argument breaks out they run into the fray armed and with the
intention of maiming the contestants.  They take great joy in breaking bones
and slicing flesh.  Looking at their eager &+We&+rye&+Ws&n is discomforting.  &n

&+BHere a small statue decorates the corner.  It depicts a single &+Ydwarf&+B standing&n
&+Bimpassive against a large army of &+ghobgoblins&+B pouring into his cave.  The &+Ydwarf&n
&+Bhas a sad hard look in his eyes and appears ready for death swinging his axe&n
&+Bmethodically.  At the base of the sculpture is an &+Yinscription&+B.  Besides this&n

&+Bwith such force that he is hitting the wall almost twenty feet in the air.&n

greet invaders here.  As well portcullis's can be dropped from the ceiling to
trap invader's and compartmentalize them and maximize the effectiveness of
the defenses.&N

the populace travel around the Colloseum.&n

&nCompact Soldier's Barracks&n~
&n   These barracks house some of the common soldiers found within the city.
While these soldiers are not extremely talented, they are good fodder and a
good first wave of &+rattack&n so that when the serious forces come to bear, the
tide of battle turns easily for them.  While the quarters are better than those
of the mine guards, it is not by much.  These &+ghobgoblins&n are the grunts of
the military of &+rT&+gor&+rg&n.&n

&+WThe Corner Of The Great Colloseum&n~

&+WWith two &+Lobsidian walls&+W on either side a certain comfort in solidity is at&n

&+WThe Center Of The North Wall&n~
&+W   This is the exact opposite side of the gladiator's entrance.  A stairway&n
&+Wwinds upwards in the north wall to a locked door.  A &+gla&+cu&+grel&+W symbol decorates&n
&+Wthis door indicating that it is for the victor to ascend.  During the games the&n
&+rCham&+Lpion&+W is let out last and must return with his medallion to leave the&n
&+Warena.  Should he fall in battle, the last alive takes the prize and ascends&n
&+Wthese stairs to where one of the councelor's bestows the &+glau&+cr&+gels&+W upon them.&n
&+WThis freedom is for only the last standing which is apparent as a &+rstream&+W of&n
&+rblood&+W flies by from the east.   &n

&n   Here the vine covered and laurel decorated doors mark the way out.  They
are firmly locked and do not have a keyhole however to the right of the door a
small slot awaits the medallion's pressure.

&+WMoving Around The Perimeter Of The Great Colloseum&n~
&+W   This &+Lwall&+W seems to keep all the "contestants" caged in quite effectively.&n
&+WTwenty foot walls of sheer &+Lobsidian&+W are enough to make even the stoutest of&n
&+Whearts to falter.  For without the aid of a &+ycatapult&+W and a suicidal attitude&n
&+Wescape into the stands seems out of the question.  Along the edges &+rblood&n
&+Wdroplets and ropes have been sprayed in deeper &+Lblack&+W lines on the walls&n
&+Wthemselves. &n

&+WThe Corner Of The Great Colloseum&n~
&+W   This corner of the arena feels a bit more secure than the open ground.&n
&+WWith two &+Lobsidian walls&+W on either side a certain comfort in solidity is at&n
&+Wleast felt rather the unsteady sloshy steps of the inner ring's &+rblood delu&+yged&n
&+ysand&+W.  Here you are below the wall that separates all gladiator's from&n
&+Wfreedom.  As well it keeps them from ripping the throats from the very&n
&+Wofficials who watch with &+rbeady&+W eyes.  With every step a clump of a &+rblood&n
&+Ldarkened&n &+ysand&+W flips forward with a disgustingly soft plop.  The &+rblood&n
&+Wletting has only but begun for the night.     &n

&+WClimbing The Stairs To The Councelor's Plateau&n~
&+W   Here the mightiest of warrior have climbed &+rbloody&+W and tired to their&n
&+Wfreedom.  Surprisingly the stairs and decore are above those of the standard&n
&+Wmilitary decore of the rest of the compound.  Possibly this is to calm the&n

&+WThe Councilor's Plateau&n~
&+W   Here a single councilor of &+rT&+gor&+rg&+W's stands as master of ceremonies for the&n
&+Wgames.  The elite of the follower's all come to watch the games, to socialize,&n
&+Wand indeed to network for power position.  A luxurious couch lies to either&n
&+Wside of the high backed chair where the councelor sits.  As much as the center&n
&+Wof the Colosseum attracts attention, this plateau attracts notice for the&n
&+Wobservers all wish the favor of the councelor.  However for security reasons&n
&+Wthe councilor is entirely separated from the rest of the population.&n

&+Wquite elaborately.  A gigantic &+Ys&+Wilvery mirro&+Yr&+W is against the east wall&n

seat the higher echelon of the military structure.  The &+rEnforcer&n often
sits here among the others cackling and even, to the delight of all, throws

&nThe Last Staircases Lead To Their Seats&n~
&n   The last staircases along the east wall into the Colloseum appear here.
During the fights, not a person would leave their seats.  The action is
exciting and not a person would leave before the action was fully done.  By
doing this one runs the risk of insulting the &+WCouncelor&n who is serving as
the master of ceremonies.  However, many of the higher order are interested in
hobnobbing and coming in late.  This socializing allows for many to seek
advancement through ridiculous flattery, and bribery.&n

compeletely bare.  While the well looking caves to the south have feet
occasionally pitter pattering down them, here that is not the case.  The

&n   Moving down to the east this cave moves below the Colloseum level.
Extremely plain and long the tube has an eerie quality stemming from it's lack
of decor.  The thudding of gladiators can be heard pounding the ground from
above.  Along the ground many trails lead eastward where apparently creatures
of all size and shape have been dragged for an unknown purpose.  Thin trails
of &+rblood&n lead up along the walls to small chutes from the Colloseum
somewhere.  Why bodies would be sent here is a mystery.&n

&nNearing The Sanctum Of &+rT&+gor&+rg&n~
&n   Here the tube continues downward to what appears to be the single most
important area in the compound.  The trails of &+rblood&n continue now forward
along the ground towards the sanctum.  Occasionally in the dust, a claw mark
where a prisoner grasped with their last bit of strength, is apparent.  Now the
slanting tunnel must indeed be almost two stories below the level of the
gladiators themselves.&n

&nEnourmous Doors Before The Sanctum&n~
&n   A gigantic set of &+ygranite&n double doors blocks the way to &+rT&+gor&+rg&n's sanctum.
The doors are enormous and bear simply the &+Wskull&n and &+yspear&n of &+rT&+gor&+rg&n.
Here the lack of decoration is exactly the same except for the large &+Ldark&n
&+bsw&+Cirl&+bing&n pattern on the floor.  In the center of the elaborate pattern
is an eerie &+We&+ry&+We&n.  Something appears to be glittering in the very center
of it.   &n

&+m   Here is the first room within the sanctum of the vaunted leader of the&n
&+mempire.  In this first room the bare tunnel leading to the sanctum itself is&n
&+mdefied for the decoration inside.  Everywhere within decorations and elaborate&n
&+msculptures create a lavish atmosphere of comfort and luxury.  Along the walls&n
&+man image of giant atop a pile of &+rc&+Worpse&+rs&+m seems a stark contrast to gem studded&n
&+Ycandle&+m holders along the wall.  One must commend &+rT&+gor&+rg&+m's taste in everything.&n

While most other tunnels inside these caverns are rather well made, this has
a rough quality to it.  Whereas the &+Ydwarves&n made most of the caves, these
tunnels most likely were dug by shaky bleeding &+ggoblin&n hands.  Unfinished
planes of obsidian are the result of extreme laziness on the part of the
workers.  Had this tunnel been made for the higher of &+rT&+gor&+rg&n's servants then this
would not be the case.  However mostly simple commoners tread these paths.&n

Apparently some of the &+rCham&+Lpion&n's handiwork that is thrown to the crowd, are
not carried off as prized possesions.  &n

&nThe Gladiators Prison&n~
&n  This building was built as the top office of the gladiators' prison.  Below&n
&nthe combatants are housed in preparation for the ensuing battles which&n
&nentertain the elite of the empire of Torg.  All about armor is being brought&n
&nin, and different weapons are being prepared for the combatants.  A stairway&n
&nleads down into the prison itself, but only those guards unlucky enough to&n
&ndraw duty there go down.

&NThe &+LStaging&n Area&n~
&n  All about, gladiators are being hustled here and there by their guards.  If&n
&nAny of the gladiators begins acting up, one of the roving larger guards will&n
&nput a swift end to the insurrection with brutal force.  The hallways extend&n
&nand as each gladiator is hustled about from station to station, the thunderous&n
&napplause heard from above rattles the ground above the prison just enough.&n
&nOften their eyes can be seen drifting to the ceiling as the realization of&n
&ntheir fate becomes clearer.&n

&NThe &+LStaging&n Area&n~
&n  The staging area continues here, as the rough looking gladiators are getting&n
&npushed ever forward.  A lion's roar is heard nearby as one of the many beasts&n
&nis readied for departure into the Coloseum.  Rivulets of blood can be seen&n
&ndrawing veins into the walls themselves from a corner where a beating must have&n
&ntaken place.&n

&NThe &+LStaging&n Area&n~
&N  This area is where the fighters prepare prior to the fight.  The warg's are&N
&Npoked, the goblins armed, and the gnomes kicked about.  All around fighters in&N
&Nchains are preparing.  Many of them walk freely from station to station as&N
&Nthey are trapped at this stage.  They can't get back through the massive&N
&Nstaging door because the ogres can see through a slit in it.  By the same token&N
&Nthey will not fight the guards for fear of the torture which will ensue.&n

&NThe &+LStaging&n Area&n~
&+L  Prior to the gladiators being sent on, they must be organized and grouped.&n
&+LHere they are grouped into teams, or allowed to work on their own.  The large&n
&+Lchain fence to the east blocks off a group at a time to be let into the&n
&+LColloseum.  When the chain fence is closed the group then must wait.  When the&n
&+Lgolem above opens the stairway that group is then forced into the Colloseum&n
&+Lusing very brutal force.  The guards surrounding this area keep the combatants&n
&+Lin check as they carefull sort out interesting groups.  They have to be&n
&+Lparticularly aware of their surroundings as soon to be combatants are standing&n
&+Lside by side.&n

&+LThe Lineup&n~
&+L  To the west, a chain fence blocks the combatants from leaving, and above a&N
&+Lsmall stairway ends in an iron hatch.  When the group is in here it must&N
&+Lsimply await for the hatch to open, and for them to be herded above by a not&N
&+Ltoo nice golem.  Although the occasional group does end up fighting each other&N
&+Lin this space, most are smart enough to realize that they have a better chance&N
&+Lsimply trying to work with those they are grouped with.  Nobody possesses keys&N
&+Lto this room besides the group selector, the golem above, and the iron&n
&+rbloodhounds&+L when they come to make an appearance.&N

&+LAn ancient &+rbattlerager&n &+Lrelic dominates the center of this neatly organized
&+Lchamber. The relic displays dwarves mining, crafting, and creating weapons of
&+Rwar&+L. The depictions look ancient. Adorning the top of the pyramid, are
&+Lancient runes written in ancient dwarvish that predate the &+rlost clans.&n

&+WPower &+Lcontinues to eminate from the relic.
