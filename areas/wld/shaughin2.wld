&+LA &+WStrange &+LDead-end in the Tunnel&n~
&+L     Here the smooth tunnel comes to an abrupt end, as though whoever
&+Lcreated it in the first place simply lost the desire to continue it
&+Lany farther north.  A very low growling sound, more echos and low
&+Lrumbling whispers then any tangible noise, emanates from the south
&+Lwhere the tunnel continues on.  The smooth walls of the cavern here
&+Lare covered by the trademark glowing moss which bathes the entirety of
&+Lthis cavern system in a gentle light.  The wet muck which covers the
&+Lupper cavern system has been replaced here by a sticky dry mud which
&+Lis marred by the occasional massive clawed footprint.  Scratches on
&+Lthe cavern wall, made by what must be incredibly strong claws or other
&+Lnatural weapons also indicate the presence of what might be dangerous
&+Lcreatures here.&n

&+LA &+WTunnel &+LWithin the &+mCaverns&n~
&+L     To the north it looks like the tunnel may come to an end, as not
&+Lmuch is visible farther that direction.  A very low growling sound,
&+Lmore echos and low rumbling whispers then any tangible noise, emanates
&+Lfrom the south where the tunnel continues on.  The smooth walls of the
&+Lcavern here are covered by the trademark glowing moss which bathes the
&+Lentirety of this cavern system in a gentle light.  The wet muck which
&+Lcovers theupper cavern system has been replaced here by a sticky dry
&+Lmud which is marred by the occasional massive clawed footprint.
&+LScratches on the cavern wall, made by what must be incredibly strong
&+Lclaws or other natural weapons also indicate the presence of what
&+Lmight be dangerous creatures here.  To the south, the light appears
&+Lto brighten as though the tunnel opens up into a greater, wider chamber.&n

&+LBefore a &+WMaze &+Lof Twisting &+mCaverns&n~
&+L     Here the tunnel which appears fairly uniform to the north, enters
&+La larger system of twisting caverns to the south.  Subtle growling,
&+Lscraping, and snorting sounds can be heard emanating from the south,
&+Lgiving this room an unsettling feeling.  The footprints which are
&+Lpressed into the dry sticky mud here also look disturbingly large,
&+Lsome even impossibly large.  The closer to the south the footprints
&+Loccurr, the more frequently they appear.  The sounds and sights here
&+Lare a less then subtle hint that to the south there could be &+rdanger&+L.&n

&+LA &+rLair &+Lof &+yBears&n~
&+L     Here the maze of tunnels has come to an abrupt end in a smooth
&+Lwalled chamber with a wide circular shape.  Perhaps the nesting ground
&+Lof whatever creature once inhabited and created this maze of tunnels,
&+Lthis chamber now makes an ideal home for the massive cavern bears which
&+Lcurrently reside here.  A low growling sound reverberates off the walls
&+Lhere, seeming to scream &+rDANGER&+L.&n

&+LA &+WMaze &+Lof Twisting &+mCaverns&n~
&+L     This area is a horribly confusing mass of tunnels heading off
&+Lin every direction imaginably.  Only a few of the tunnels are large
&+Lenough to accomdate even the smallest of humanoid creatures, although
&+Lthe thousands of smaller holes riddle every surface here.  The original
&+Ldenziens of this maze and likely creators of the tunnels are long since
&+Lvanished to the unfathomable depths of the underdark, leaving a vast
&+Lplayground for the animals which have since taken up residence here.
&+LWhile the plethora of smaller holes provide cover and safety for small
&+Lcave rats and cavern snakes both of which can be seen in glimpses
&+Ltraversing the endless tunnels, the place is strangly absent of any
&+Lof the larger animals which would normally be present.  The massive
&+Lclawed footprints which occasionally marr the fairly dry but still
&+Lsticky mud here perhaps have something to do with their absence.  Both
&+La low gutteral growling sound and a smooth scraping sound seem to come
&+Lfrom all directions at once, echoing hauntingly through this maze of
&+Ltunnels and further erasing any sense of direction.&n

&+LA &+WPath &+Lof &+GGlowing &+WMushrooms&n~
&+L     Here a more uniform tunnel winds through the maze of twisting and
&+Lconfusing tunnels which mark the lower hunting grounds of the shaughin.
&+LAlong this tunnel the dim glow of the cavern moss is drown out by the
&+Lthe much brighter light cast by the strange mushrooms which continue
&+Lin a strange line along the center of the tunnel.  A sense of &+Wpeace&n
&+Lseems to emanate from these mushrooms, and anywhere the strange green
&+Llight seems to fall there are none of the normal signs of life left by
&+Lthe dangerous creatures which reside in these caverns.  It also appears
&+Lthat someone, perhaps the shaughin, are intentionally cultivating these
&+Lmushrooms as there are traces of ground mulch scattered along the line
&+Lof mushrooms.&n

&+LA &+WMaze &+Lof Twisting &+mCaverns&n~
&+L     This area is a horribly confusing mass of tunnels heading off
&+Lin every direction imaginably.  Only a few of the tunnels are large
&+Lenough to accomdate even the smallest of humanoid creatures, although
&+Lthe thousands of smaller holes riddle every surface here.  The original
&+Ldenziens of this maze and likely creators of the tunnels are long since
&+Lvanished to the unfathomable depths of the underdark, leaving a vast
&+Lplayground for the animals which have since taken up residence here.
&+LWhile the plethora of smaller holes provide cover and safety for small
&+Lcave rats and cavern snakes both of which can be seen in glimpses
&+Ltraversing the endless tunnels, the place is strangly absent of any

&+LA &+WMaze &+Lof Twisting &+mCaverns&n~
&+L     This area is a horribly confusing mass of tunnels heading off
&+Lin every direction imaginably.  Only a few of the tunnels are large
&+Lenough to accomdate even the smallest of humanoid creatures, although
&+Lthe thousands of smaller holes riddle every surface here.  The original
&+Ldenziens of this maze and likely creators of the tunnels are long since
&+Lvanished to the unfathomable depths of the underdark, leaving a vast
&+Lplayground for the animals which have since taken up residence here.
&+LWhile the plethora of smaller holes provide cover and safety for small
&+Lcave rats and cavern snakes both of which can be seen in glimpses
&+Ltraversing the endless tunnels, the place is strangly absent of any
&+Lof the larger animals which would normally be present.  The massive
&+Lclawed footprints which occasionally marr the fairly dry but still
&+Lsticky mud here perhaps have something to do with their absence.  Both
&+La low gutteral growling sound and a smooth scraping sound seem to come
&+Lfrom all directions at once, echoing hauntingly through this maze of
&+Ltunnels and further erasing any sense of direction.&n

&+L     Here a more uniform tunnel winds through the maze of twisting and
&+Lconfusing tunnels which mark the lower hunting grounds of the shaughin.
&+LAlong this tunnel the dim glow of the cavern moss is drown out by the
&+Lthe much brighter light cast by the strange mushrooms which continue
&+Lin a strange line along the center of the tunnel.  A sense of &+Wpeace&n
&+Lseems to emanate from these mushrooms, and anywhere the strange green
&+Llight seems to fall there are none of the normal signs of life left by
&+Lthe dangerous creatures which reside in these caverns.  It also appears
&+Lthat someone, perhaps the shaughin, are intentionally cultivating these
&+Lmushrooms as there are traces of ground mulch scattered along the line

&+LA &+WPath &+Lof &+GGlowing &+WMushrooms&n~
&+L     Here a more uniform tunnel winds through the maze of twisting and
&+Lconfusing tunnels which mark the lower hunting grounds of the shaughin.
&+LAlong this tunnel the dim glow of the cavern moss is drown out by the
&+Lthe much brighter light cast by the strange mushrooms which continue
&+Lin a strange line along the center of the tunnel.  A sense of &+Wpeace&n
&+Lseems to emanate from these mushrooms, and anywhere the strange green
&+Llight seems to fall there are none of the normal signs of life left by
&+Lthe dangerous creatures which reside in these caverns.  It also appears
&+Lthat someone, perhaps the shaughin, are intentionally cultivating these
&+Lmushrooms as there are traces of ground mulch scattered along the line
&+Lof mushrooms.&n

&+LA &+WMaze &+LBefore a Dark &+rLair&n~
&+L     Here the maze of tiny, small, medium, and large tunnels seems to
&+Lconsolidate down to a single passage.  The walls begin to grow smooth
&+Lalong the largest tunnel, which also seems to widen as the passage
&+Lprogresses.  The ground is matted by small tufts of fur which appear

&+Lsound which echo's through the rest of the maze is much more prevalent
&+Lhere, growing quite loud and achieving the bassy rumble usually only
&+Lassociated with large wagon convoys and siege equipment moving across
&+Lrocky terrain.  Whatever lies ahead which is producing this sound must
&+Lbe quite massive indeed, and is likely a force to be reckoned with.&n

&+LAn Old &+rCampfire &+Lin the &+WMaze&n~
&+L     Here the maze seems somewhat less daunting, as several of the
&+Lwalls here do not contain the trademark sponge like mass of tunnels
&+Lof all widths leading off in random directions.  The southern wall
&+Lin particular is fairly smooth and unmarred, an oddity within the
&+Lhunting grounds of the lower caverns.  Signs of sentient life such as
&+Lbroken arrowheads, bits of leather, and discarded bits of fur abound
&+Lhere.  The remnants of an old campfire, many times rekindled sits in
&+Lthe center of the tunnel here, the charred wood sticking up like
&+Lbones.  On the southern wall, smooth and absent of tunnels, there
&+Lare unmistakable tool marks which perhaps warrant a much longer
&+Linvestigation.&n

&+LA &+WPath &+Lof &+GGlowing &+WMushrooms&n~
&+L     Here a more uniform tunnel winds through the maze of twisting and
&+Lconfusing tunnels which mark the lower hunting grounds of the shaughin.
&+LAlong this tunnel the dim glow of the cavern moss is drown out by the
&+Lthe much brighter light cast by the strange mushrooms which continue
&+Lin a strange line along the center of the tunnel.  A sense of &+Wpeace&n
&+Lseems to emanate from these mushrooms, and anywhere the strange green
&+Llight seems to fall there are none of the normal signs of life left by
&+Lthe dangerous creatures which reside in these caverns.  It also appears
&+Lthat someone, perhaps the shaughin, are intentionally cultivating these
&+Lmushrooms as there are traces of ground mulch scattered along the line
&+Lof mushrooms.&n

&+LA &+WMaze &+Lof Twisting &+mCaverns&n~
&+L     This area is a horribly confusing mass of tunnels heading off
&+Lin every direction imaginably.  Only a few of the tunnels are large
&+Lenough to accomdate even the smallest of humanoid creatures, although
&+Lthe thousands of smaller holes riddle every surface here.  The original
&+Ldenziens of this maze and likely creators of the tunnels are long since
&+Lvanished to the unfathomable depths of the underdark, leaving a vast
&+Lplayground for the animals which have since taken up residence here.
&+LWhile the plethora of smaller holes provide cover and safety for small
&+Lcave rats and cavern snakes both of which can be seen in glimpses
&+Ltraversing the endless tunnels, the place is strangly absent of any
&+Lof the larger animals which would normally be present.  The massive
&+Lclawed footprints which occasionally marr the fairly dry but still
&+Lsticky mud here perhaps have something to do with their absence.  Both
&+La low gutteral growling sound and a smooth scraping sound seem to come
&+Lfrom all directions at once, echoing hauntingly through this maze of
&+Ltunnels and further erasing any sense of direction.&n

&+LA &+rLair &+Lof &+yBears&n~
&+L     Here the maze of tunnels has come to an abrupt end in a smooth
&+Lwalled chamber with a wide circular shape.  Perhaps the nesting ground
&+Lof whatever creature once inhabited and created this maze of tunnels,
&+Lthis chamber now makes an ideal home for the massive cavern bears which
&+Lcurrently reside here.  A low growling sound reverberates off the walls
&+Lhere, seeming to scream &+rDANGER&+L.&n

&+LBefore A &+WMaze &+Lof Twisting &+mCaverns&n~
&+L     Here the tunnel which appears fairly uniform to the south, enters
&+La larger system of twisting caverns to the north.  Subtle growling,
&+Lscraping, and snorting sounds can be heard emanating from the north,
&+Lgiving this room an unsettling feeling.  The footprints which are
&+Lpressed into the dry sticky mud here also look disturbingly large,
&+Lsome even impossibly large.  The closer to the north the footprints
&+Loccurr, the more frequently they appear.  The sounds and sights here
&+Lare a less then subtle hint that to the north there could be &+rdanger&+L.&n

&+LA &+WTunnel &+LApproaching an &+mUnderworld &+bWaterfall&n~
&+L     To the south it looks like the tunnel may come to watery end, as
&+Lthe sound of rushing water emanates from that direction.  A very low
&+Lgrowling sound, more echos and low rumbling whispers then any tangible
&+Lnoise, emanates from the north where the tunnel continues on.  The
&+Lsmooth walls of the cavern here are covered by the trademark glowing
&+Lmoss which bathes the entirety of this cavern system in a gentle light.
&+LThe wet muck which covers theupper cavern system is also present here,
&+Lalong with the occasional puddle.  Directly to the south, what appears
&+Lto possibly be shallow, fast moving water travelling in this direction
&+Lseems to take a sudden turn to the east to pass out of the light of the
&+Linhabited underdark forever.  Scratches on the cavern wall, made
&+Lby what must be incredibly strong claws or other natural weapons
&+Lalso indicate the presence of what might be dangerous creatures here.
&+LTo the north, the light appears to brighten as though the tunnel opens
&+Lup into a greater, wider chamber.&n

&+LThe &+WBase&+L of a &+LTowering &+BWa&+baterf&+Ball&n~
&+b     Here the passage is completely filled with a large, turbulent pool
&+bof water.  A loud, echoing roaring sound created by water cascading down
&+bfrom high and crashing into the pool here drowns out all other noise in
&+bthe chamber.  While the pool is not particularly deep, the swirling
&+band unpredictable currents make it impossible to swim or wade across
&+bto the other side.  The pool empties the pool through the passage to
&+bthe north, filling that direction with swiftly moving water.  The moss
&+bwhich adorns much of the walls of this cavern system is even more abundant
&+bhere by the pool, drinking in the constant spray of airborne water which
&+bfills the chamber.  It does not seem possible for any creatures which
&+bdo not possess the ability to fly or levitate themselves to even enter
&+bthis room, let alone pass deeper into the cavern system to the north.
&+bHigh above, the cavern continues off into the darkness as the falling
&+bwater continues to cut a swathe through the once solid rock above.&n

&+LA &+mCavern &+Loff the &+mUnderdark &+LDepths&n~
&+L     Here the mighty cavernous depths of the underdark which extend into
&+Lthe pitch black darkness to the south slowly diminish and begin to form
&+Lthe start of a passage to the north.  While the long dead creators of the
&+Loriginal passage left a rough and twisting cavern, sentient beings long
&+Lago smoothed and enlarged the walls to make the tunnel fairly uniform.
&+LA very low growling sound, more echos and low rumbling whispers then any
&+Ltangible noise, emanates from the south where the tunnel continues on.
&+LThe smooth walls of the cavern here are covered by the trademark glowing
&+Lmoss which bathes the entirety of this cavern system in a gentle light.
&+LThe sound of rushing water can be heard to the north, and the watermarks
&+Lhigh upon the walls indicate that this cavern has occasionally flooded
&+Lin the past.&n

&+LA &+WSecret &+gHunting &+LPassage&n~
&+L     This passage is smooth and hand carved, and shows the signs of
&+Lrecent and constant passage.  Although possibly not created by the
&+Lshaughin which hunt the maze, it nonetheless is being used by them
&+Lto allow a secret means of entry and exit to the maze as well as a
&+Lsafe refuge for rest and kill processing.  Bits of decomposing flesh
&+Loccasionally dot the ground here, probably remnants of the kills which
&+Lare often dragged through the passage by the hunters.  The smell of
&+Lsmoking underdark vegetation permeates the passage, indicating the
&+Lpresence of a nearby campfire.&n
