&+yA &+WCustoms&+y and&+W Tariff&n &+yStation at the Front Gate of the Bailey&n~
&+y   All merchants incoming or outgoing from the bailey are required by law to&n
&+ystop here and submit to search.  While smuggling of goods is generally not&n
&+ya problem, the prevention of spies infiltrating the bailey, or even the keep&n
&+yitself is not taken lightly.  The station also makes a fair profit from the&n
&+ytariffs and duties imposed on the passing merchants.&n

&+yAlong the Southwestern Edge of the Bailey&n &+YPalisade&n~
&+y   The dirt road along the southern palisade in the grocers quarter is very&n
&+ywell-trodden from the constant passage of both soldiers and wagons.  Access&n
&+yto the bakery and the marshalling grounds is available primarily through&n
&+ythis lane, and deep wagon ruts have been cut into the ground.  Along the&n
&+ywooden palisade several thick weeds grow, although no grass is in sight.&n

&+y   A gigantic gate stands here, allowing entrance into the bailey for those&n
&+ywho desire entrance.  While open now, in times of war it is shut and doubly&n
&+ybarred, and an iron portcullis dropped behind to reinforce it from battering&n
&+yrams.  Archers are visible on platforms at the top of the palisade and&n
&+ydoubtless other surprises would await the unfortunate soul chosen to assualt&n
&+ythis castle.&n

&+yand the lane between the grocers' and smithies’ quarters to the west.&n
&+yHeavy wagon traffic here has worn the road considerably, however being&n
&+yconstructed of thick and durable cobblestone has ensured a long lifetime&n
&+yfor the boulevard.&n

&+y   Outside of the fine cutlery store, the main avenue continues its way&n
&+ythrough the bailey.  To the south can be seen the gates to the bailey, and&n
&+yto the north the massive motte upon which the keep itself has been built.&n
&+yAround the buildings the palisade walls can also be seen, the soldiers on&n
&+ythem tiny as they do their rounds while on duty.&n

&+yAlong the Northern Half of the &+WMain Avenue&n &+yThrough the Bailey&n~
&+y   The putrid smell of dead and rotting animals emanates from the store to&n
&+ythe west; that of the bailey tanner.  Since no easily accessible way for the&n
&+ytanner exists for him to dispose of his refuse, he has thrown it into the&n
&+ystreet to rot, although many of the citizens have complained to no avail.&n
&+yThe bowels of some unfortunate animal currently sit rotting in the drainage&n
&+yruts nearby.&n

&+yThe Workshop of the Bailey&n &+YWheelwright&n~
&+Y   A large pile of planks in the corner are awaiting the wheelwrights use&n
&+Yin his daily chore.  Quite possibly the hardest part of the wagon to produce&n
&+Yis the wheel, and for his skill the wheelwright is well compensated by the&n
&+Ymerchants of the castle.  Several luxurious chairs and expensive murals on&n
&+Ythe wall indicate that life is comfortable for a man with his skill.&n

&+yThe&n &+LWiredrawer's &+yStore at the Front of the Smithies' Ring&n~
&+L   The wiredrawers workshop is filled with the different sized holes used&n
&+Lfor drawing the wire blanks though.  The wire is pushed through a hole&n
&+Lslightly smaller than the wire itself each time, making the wire both longer&n
&+Land thinner.  After this process is repeated several times the desired&n
&+Lthickness is achieved, although care must be taken not to make the wire too&n
&+Lbrittle or frail.&n

&+yThe&n &+bFarrier's &+yCorner of the Smithies' Ring&n~
&+B   Several large crates in the corner are filled to capacity with different&n
&+Bsize horseshoes, an item used in excess by the light cavalry stationed just&n
&+Boutside of the castle grounds.  While a seemingly mindless and relatively&n
&+Beasy job, a bad farrier can cripple the horses of a cavalry unit, and as&n
&+Bsuch the talented man now employed is compensated well to keep him here.&n

&+yA Massive&n &+rFl&+Rami&+rng&n &+LForge&n &+yWithin the Smithies' Ring&n~
&+y   The smiths of the bailey decided long ago that their collective business&n
&+ywould increase dramatically if they formed a guild, and the result of that&n
&+yagreement is the massive forge at the rear of the smithies’ ring.  Large&n
&+yenough for ten men to work with at the same time it is kept fueled and blown&n
&+yby a magical enchantment procured from the wizards guild of a nearby city.&n

&+yThe &+WBellfounder's &+yWorkshop in the Smithies' Ring&n~
&+W   Three large iron casts in the corner are used by the bellfounder to shape&n
&+Wthe bells that he sells every day.  The smaller bells go to farmers and&n
&+Wmerchants for their daily use, however large bells are often requested by&n
&+Wthe local towns of the area for their churches or clock towers.  While not&n
&+Wa steady trade, the pay for such a job is considerable.&n

&+yThe&n &+GLimeburner's &+yStore at the Front of the Smithies' Ring&n~
&+g   A large pile of limestone in the corner of the store is destined for the&n
&+gforge, where the extreme temperatures will burn off the carbonates within&n
&+gand leave the fine lime behind.  Used by builders for mortar, the substance&n
&+gis very difficult to procure without extreme heat, and as such the other&n
&+gsmiths are often put out by the limeburners request for excessive heat.&n

&+yThe stairway up the tower seems extremely rickety, however thick beams have&n

&+yAlong the Path up the&n &+gMotte&+y Approaching the&n &+LKeep&n~
&+y   The slope of the road steepens greatly here as it begins the climb up the&n
&+ymotte to the keep of the castle itself.  Large wooden palisades on both&n
&+ysides of the lane loom overhead, and the bustle of soldiers above on the&n
&+yplatforms can be heard quite clearly.  Unlike the roads in the bailey, this&n
&+yone is in immaculate condition, obviously well-cared for.&n

&+yAlong the Path Up the &+gMotte&n &+yApproaching the&n &+LKeep&n~
&+y   The road lessens its slope as it approaches the top of the massive motte,&n
&+yupon which the castle keep has been constructed.  The keep itself can be&n
&+yseen quite clearly from here, an imposing structure of several stories, made&n
&+yfrom dark granite rock.  Several banners flutter about in the breeze above&n
&+ythe keep.&n

&+y   The gates leading into the keep stand here, made of oak thick enough to&n
&+yhold off the largest battering ram for several hours at least.  A large&n
&+yheraldic shield mounted above the keep gates bears the coat-of-arms of the&n
&+yDuke, its well-polished surface gleaming in the light.  Small holes above&n
&+ythe door are positioned to give archers above a clear shot at attackers&n
&+ywhile limiting the attackers chance to fire in return.&n

&+yA Heavy&n &+LStone&n &+yPlatform on the Eastern&n &+cTower&n~
&+y   This massive tower is capped by a huge platform holding several war&n
&+yengines, among them mangonels, catapults and ballistas.  Piles of ammunition&n
&+ynearby are ready in case heavy firing breaks out, and a heavy block and&n
&+ytackle is available for for lifting more if the need arises.  The weapons&n

&+yA Narrow Platform at the Southeastern Corner of the&n &+YPalisade&n~
&+y   This platform at the southeastern corner is especially reinforced, as in&n
&+ytimes of war it is heavily manned with soldiers and archers to rain death&n
&+ydown upon a foe below.  The heavy planking is supplemented with thick iron&n
&+ysupport beams, and small holes have been drilled in the palisade to afford&n
&+yan archer a shot at an enemy below while offering him superior protection.&n

&+yA Narrow Platform on the Southern &+gMotte&+Y Palisade&n~
&+y   The southern platform on the palisade affords a clear view of the bailey&n
&+ybelow, and also supplies an excellent vantage point for archers to attack&n
&+yany enemies unwise enough to attack the motte directly.  The heavy wood of&n
&+ythe platform is reinforced here to prevent it from collapsing, and a railing&n
&+yhas been erected to prevent men from falling to their demise below.&n

&+yprovide a superior defense to attack, although it is unlikely an enemy would&n
&+ychoose this specific spot to attack.  Any unlucky foes caught below would&n
&+ybe held in a vicious three-way crossfire from archers.&n

&+y   The keep roof stretches in all directions, from here except to the south,&n
&+ywhich leads to the stairway down into the keep.  The foot of a large tower&n
&+ystands here, with a wooden ladder leading to an observation tower above.  A&n
&+ylarge flagpole can be seen looming even higher above the platform, the tip&n
&+yof it wavering in the steady winds.&n

&+yUpon the Sprawling Rooftop of the &+LKeep&n~
&+y   The rooftop of the keep stretches in all directions, with the crenels of&n
&+ythe battlements visible in the distance.  The massive observation tower and&n
&+ythe shack holding the stairway into the keep can also be seen.  Stacks of&n
&+yboulders and ballista bolts lie here and there, ready for quick rearmament&n
&+yin the even the castle is taken under siege.&n

&+yAlong the Southern Crenelations of the&+L Keep&+y Roof&n~
&+y   The large crenels of the roof battle ments here provide excellent cover&n
&+yfor any archers who wish to shoot at an enemy below.  The blocks themselves&n
&+yare made of hard granite several inches thick, easily large enough to stop&n
&+ya crossbow bolt and likely to withstand anything but a direct hit with a&n
&+ymangonel or catapult.&n

&+yHalfway Up the Ladder of the &+LKeep&n &+yRoof Observation Tower&n~
&+y   The ladder up the tower is extremely rickety, threatening to break at&n
&+yany time and send the bearer hurtling to the rooftop below.  The planking&n
&+yused as steps is pulling out in several places, and several jagged nails&n
&+yjust out threatening to poke or scratch someone.  A rail has been rigged to&n
&+ythe ladder, although in truth it looks just as dangerous to hold it.&n

&+yA Large Observation Platform at the Top of the&n &+LKeep&n &+yTower&n~
&+y   Here lies the large observation platform of the keep.  Bolted with large&n
&+yiron pegs to the rickety tower it is a marvel it stands at all.  It is only&n
&+yupon close inspection that a light green glow is seen surrounding the tower,&n
&+yand then it is obvious how the tower still stands.  Railing has been nailed&n
&+yon all around the platform, for a fall to the rooftop below would almost&n
&+ycertainly be a fatal one.&n

&+cIn Midair Halfway Up the Tall Flagpole on the Tower&n~
&+B   The slick iron flagpole stretches further into the air, continuing&n
&+Bupward.  A look down shows that the platform is quite a distance below,&n
&+Band a fall from this height would almost certainly be painful.  Only those&n
&+Bwith the greatest aptitude for climbing or those enchanted with the gift&n
&+Bof flight are able to stay here for long.&n

&+cIn Midair at the Top of the Tall Flagpole on the Tower&n~
&+B   The top of the flagpole is here, whipping about as it is buffeted by the&n
&+Bheavy winds.  Unusual for a flagpole, there is no pulley to run a line up to&n
&+Band through, merely a set of eyebolts for latching the flagpole directly&n
&+Binto.  A look down shows the great distance above the keep, and the view&n
&+Baround the countryside is even more magnificent than ever.&n
