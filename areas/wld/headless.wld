&+gApproaching a&n &+LMassive Iron Portcullis&n~
&+g   A dirt road cuts through the area heading off east into the countryside&n
&+gand west towards a massive walled city.  Thick plumes of dark smoke are&n
&+grising steadily from behind the walls as if something were burning almost&n
&+gcontinuously.  A thick smell of sulfur also invades the nostrils as a fresh&n
&+gbreeze rises from the west.  Bones on the side of the road seem to indicate&n
&+gthat this is most definitely not a safe place to have a picnic.&n

&+gBefore a&n &+LMassive Iron Portcullis&n~
&+g   A huge iron portcullis has been erected as a gateway into and out of the&n
&+gcity of Zalkapfaan.  A team of several experienced mages took three months&n
&+gto complete the intricate workings that operate the device, although it&n
&+gworks exactly as required.  A simple turn of a key now raises the portcullis&n
&+galmost instantly, a device which weighs several tonnes and would require&n
&+gnormally a team of twenty draft horses to accomplish.&n

&+gThe Central Intersection of&n &+LZalkapfaan&n~
&+g   This large and expansive intersection marks the crossing of the two major&n
&+groads of Zalkapfaan.  One runs from the giant magical portcullis int the&n
&+geast to some gigantic buildings in the west.  The other road seems to lead&n
&+gto an immense wharf in the north and to a small gathering of canvas tents&n
&+gto the south.  The roads themselves are filthy and cracked, and several&n
&+glarge holes are visible from missing rocks in the cobblestone.&n

&+YApproaching the Docks of&n &+LZalkapfaan&n~
&+g   The road continues from the south before ending at the footsteps of a&n
&+gmassive oaken wharf.  The construction methods used seem to be several times&n
&+gmore extensive than any other wharf, as if designed to hold immense loads&n
&+gof weight on them.  Unlike the roads the dock is in immaculate condition&n
&+gand has been kept under excellent maintenance for the duration of its&n
&+gexistence.  The result is a structure well worn from use but no less in its&n
&+gfunctionality from the time it was created.&n

&+y   The massive oaken planks of the wharf are well worn with the constant&n
&+yshuffling of soldiers and supplies as the fleet prepares for another naval&n
&+yinvasion of its enemies.  Crates of supplies are stacked up neatly in&n
&+ypiles along the side, and thick ropes along the side of the dock keep&n
&+ysupplies from being pushed over the side by heavy waves.  Many of the&n
&+ycrates are waterlogged as if having been in the water at some point,&n
&+yalthough their solid construction has kept any of the contents from being&n
&+yexposed to the corrosive sea water.&n

&+W   A large ivory statue in the center of the groom glows brightly, a slight&n
&+Whaze of brilliant white light around it.  The face on the statue is one of &n
&+Wextreme peace and contentment, although the garb worn by the figure is&n
&+Wcracked and chipping in places.  Several oil sconces on the walls provide&n
&+Willumination to the shrine, and as a whole the area is very well kept.&n

&+cApproaching the Shrine to&n &+WMalra&n~
&+C   Suprisingly clean, this hall takes a sharp bend to the west, where a&n
&+Cwell-lit room in the distance can be seen.  The tiles of the corridor are&n
&+Cshiny and buffed to a neat shine, and the walls are free of any dirt or&n
&+Cgrease spot.  A small trickle of blood flows in from the altar to the north&n
&+Csoiling what otherwise would be a remarkably nice room.&n

&+gBefore the &+yDrawbridge&n &+gof a Huge&n &+LGranite Keep&n~
&+g   The central road of Zalkapfaan ends here before a massive drawbridge.&n
&+gJust beyond the drawbridge lies the huge granite keep, a foreboding and &n
&+gimposing sight.  A large banner can be seen flapping in the breeze over &n
&+gthe keep, a conglomeration of crimson and black in a violent pattern with&n
&+gmany sharp angles.  Several pikes are also driven into the ground, each&n
&+gwith the head of a humanoid on it, those deemed unworthy of becoming a&n
&+gmember of the headless horde.&n

&+gAtop a Great&n &+YOaken Drawbridge&n &+gin Front of the Huge&n &+LGranite Keep&n~
&+y   A full eighty yards across, this drawbridge crosses the murky water&n
&+ybelow.  In times of war the drawbridge is closed due to several attempts&n
&+yin the past to infiltrate the area with magically diguised spies.  It is&n
&+ysaid that several creatures have added to the moat to ensure no-one is&n
&+yfool-hardy enough to try swimming across it.  On the south side of the&n
&+ydrawbridge lies the enormous gates allowing entry into the keep.&n

&+bIn the Murky Moat Outside the&n &+LKeep&n~
&+b   The dark blue waters of the moat roll heavily, and small chunks of&n
&+brubbish are tossed around easily.  The water itself smells of sewage,&n
&+bperhaps the headless use it for more than simply defense.  To the east&n
&+blies the drawbridge to the keep, while to the west is a haze of fog, a dull&n
&+bthrobbing emanating from it.&n

&+bIn the Murky Moat Outside the&n &+LKeep&n~
&+b   A dark blue haze settles over the moat here although from where the haze&n
&+bemanates is not obvious.  The water itself rolls heavily, and the bones of&n
&+ban unfortunate soul are on the north bank.  A bloated, half-eaten corpse&n
&+bbobs about, the upper torso snapped off by one of the creatures of the moat.&n
&+bA small pipe from the keep has raw sewage flowing from it, the smell quite&n
&+bawful, even with the stench of death about.&n

&+yA Dark and Gloomy Hallway Within the&n &+LKeep&n~
&+y   This dank and dark hallway stretches down from one end of the keep to the&n
&+yother, snaking around many corners.  The dark rock walls glisten with some&n
&+ysort of moisture, not water, something darker, thicker.  The solid rock&n
&+yfloor is well-worn from the endless patrols of the guards and the ceiling&n
&+yis covered in the cobwebs of a host of arachnids.&n

&+yAlong the Dark Hallway Within the&n &+LKeep&n~
&+y   The hallway contines deeper into the keep, the floor grimy and muddy from&n
&+ythe tracks of the patrolling guards.  A large mass of piping runs along the&n
&+yceiling and the sounds of fluids running within them can be clearly heard.&n
&+ySeveral large oil sconces provide illumination for the area, the shadows&n
&+ydancing wildly across the hall.&n

&+yA Sharp Bend in the Hallway Within the&n &+LKeep&n~
&+y   The filthy hallway takes a sudden turn here, breaking sharply as it heads&n
&+ydeeper into the bowels of the large keep.  Many of the oil sconces on the&n
&+ywalls are extinguished, and those that are still lit provide little in the&n
&+yway of illumination.  Several ratty tapestries adorn the walls, and a statue&n
&+yof a beautiful maiden has been defaced, literally, as the ivory head has&n
&+ybeen ripped off the beautiful shoulders.&n

&+yOutside a Pair of Massive&n &+YOaken Doors&n~
&+y   The normally filthy hallway seems cleaner here than elsewhere, as the&n
&+yhallway approaches a massive set of oaken doors.  The massive wooden planks&n
&+yused for the door are precisely cut, resulting in a door as solidly built&n
&+yas is possible discluding the use of magic.  Unlike the rest of the hallway&n
&+yvery few footprints lead through the doors, marking it as an area of much&n
&+yless traffic than the others.&n

&+yA Sharp Turn Within the Hallway in the&n &+LKeep&n~
&+y   The hallway takes another sharp turn here, its corridors dark and musky&n
&+ywith a think, rank smell.  Several tracks in the grime indicate something, &n
&+yor someone, has been dragged through here recently, and another set of&n
&+ytracks are from some sort of beast with more than four legs.  The oil flasks&n
&+ydimly light the area, casting flickering shadows upon the entire area.&n

&+yA Long Hallway in the&n &+LKeep&+y, Doors on Both Sides&n~
&+y   The hallway narrows here, and several large oaken doors on each side lead&n
&+yto rooms within the keep.  The doors are made of solid planks of thick oak,&n
&+ythe kind usually reserved for boat building.  A large crystal chandelier&n
&+yhangs from the ceiling here, although none of its candles are lit.&n
&+yWhether this means the headless have some other means of sight beyond the&n
&+ypurely visual is pure speculation.&n

&+yEnd of a Dark and Gloomy Hallway Within the&n &+LKeep&n~
&+y   The dark hallway comes to an abrupt end here, with two thick doors on&n
&+yeach side of the corridor.  Large scratch marks adorn each door, and a thick&n
&+yputrid smell emanates from behind them mingled with a scent of death.  The&n
&+ystone of the side walls is the same as that used for the internal walls of&n
&+ythe keep, however the end wall is composed of the dark granite of which&n
&+ythe outer walls of the keep are made up of.&n

&+LA Training Pit for the&n &+CXorn&n~
&+c   Used as the Xorn training area, this is where mature Xorn are taught the&n
&+ccombat techniques they use when in combat with the headless.  Several large&n
&+ctargets are scattered about the area, all showing incredible bit marks and&n
&+call nearly torn in half by the mighty muscles of a Xorn.  A large wooden&n
&+cstump in the middle of the room is used by the Xorn to vent their anger&n
&+capon, as often their are not enough slaves to provide live sport for all of&n
&+cthe trainees.&n

&+LA Putrid&n &+CXorn&n &+LNest&n~
&+c   This room reeks of death, pure concentrated death.  Used as a nest for&n
&+cthe Xorn queens, several dozen hatchlings a year are raised here until they&n
&+care near the age where they can start to be trained.  Their ferocious&n
&+cinstincts are enough to guide them through this time as they savagely&n
&+cdevour anything that cannot defend itself.  Judging by the many large piles&n
&+cof bones they are fed all too often, and their food is not always dead&n
&+cwhen it served.&n

&+Cis a large cedar table, covered in maps and scrolls.  Used as a meeting area&n
&+Cfor those the force commander deems worthy of meeting with, entry into this&n
&+Croom is viewed as a sign of extreme prestige and rank by the normally&n
&+Cpolitically inert headless.  To the west is a large door, framed in a&n
&+Cglowing purple light of obvious magical origin.&n

&+c   Used as a study area for the force commander, currently Kal-Zerr, this&n
&+carea is covered with various books and scrolls.  How the headless read these&n
&+cartifacts is not immediately clear, although in all probability the use of&n
&+csome sort of magic is required, be it clerical or sorcerous.  Several&n
&+cimpressive war trophys adorn the walls of the study, a shriveled grey elf&n
&+chead here, an dessicated ogre face there, and many others besides.&n

&+c   The walls of this room are covered in several large maps, with several&n
&+cmarkers denoting the positions of various forces within the headless horde.&n
&+cAlthough the bulk of the army is currently in Zalkapfaan it is obvious that&n
&+cthe horde is scouting out several areas for invasion, including such&n
&+cstrongholds as Tharnadia, Woodseer, Khildarak, and even the fabled drow&n
&+ccity of Aracdrathos.  While universally agreed upon as evil the headless&n
&+cby no means prey upon the righteous alone ..&n
