&+LArd'gral the &+CQuasi-Elemental&+L Plane of Dreams&n~
  This is an interplanar space where the thoughts of
dreamers come together in a never-ending ethereal mist.
There is a glow to the area, but no visible sources of
light.  In the background, there is something audible,
could it be voices?  The bards of Duris sing about this
place, calling in Ard'gral.
