The &+gCommon Room&n of the &+yBlinking Cowl Inn&n~
&n   The Blinking Cowl Inn is a rather popular resting place for the weary
travelers that frequent this desert city of the nomads. Although quite small in
comparison to many other Inns, the Blinking Cowl provides a comfortable
sanctuary for those who need a good night's rest, or shelter from the sun. The
price for ale is high, thus discouraging the locals from even bothering with
the place, thus attracting the richer populous of the city. The rooms, however,
are quite reasonably priced, considering its strategic location in the very
center of the city. The common room is designed rather cozy, with a few
circular rugs and a crackling fireplace in the southern wall. Several tables
are positioned around the room, used mainly by guests when they eat their
meals. A small stage has been pushed against the western wall, used by local
bards to perform their latest poems and songs. The reception area is here and
the bakery to the north, where travelers can purchase their food for the night.

A &+yLi&+wg&+yht&+wl&+yy&n &+yH&+Lu&+ye&+Ld&n &+LCobbles&+yt&+Lo&+yne&n Road~
&+y   The stones have a light red color to them. More than likely the stones
&+yhave a great deal of clay within them. Some of these stones were in fact created
&+yby being glazed by extremely hot furnaces from within the city. This street
&+yis very wide, simply because it is frequented the most by many different races
&+yof many different lands. This particular section of the city, if there could be
&+yone, is the center. Alongside either side of the stone road tents are set up to
&+yhouse the nomads that frequent the city. Most of these nomads stay no more than
&+ya few months, some much briefer. Sounds of city life fill the air during the
&+ydays while, however, during the night only the slave traders are active,
&+yselling their merchandise. Slave traders come from all over the lands to trade
&+yhere, for it is well known that nearly no other city would allow such an
&+yinhumane business within its walls.

A Lightly &+yPebbled &+LGr&+ga&+Lve&+gl&n Road~
&+y   This lightly pebbled road cuts along the northern cliff of the desert city,
&+ywinding its way along the cold stone like a vicious desert snake. Sand blows
&+yin small patches along the walkway, but most is kept from the city by the
&+ywalls and special barricades that line its perimeter. Squat huts and clay
&+yhouses of a varying size have been built along the road, taking up every
&+yavailable space and leaving little room for alleys and yards. The occasional
&+yhardy shrub grows up from the dry ground, but for the most part this region
&+yis barren of plant and animal life. Only the tiniest pebble stirs here, as the
&+ywind gently blows it along the winding desert city tracks. During the daytime,
&+ythis is the most blistering part of the city, and during the night it could be
&+ymistaken for a barren wasteland, truly the most vacant section of the city.

Outside a &+yFo&+Lr&+yt&+Li&+yfi&+Led&+Y Gate~
&+Y   The strong &+Lfortified &+ygates&n &+Yhave been reinforced do the lack of&+c security
&+Ywithin the town. This is the greatest misconception of those who enter; that
&+Ythese gates aren't meant to keep people out, they keep the people in. Once
&+Ysomeone has passed beyond these gates, they're &+bfair&+b game&+Y. It is rumored that
&+Ynomads just passing through have been caught unsuspectingly and sold into
&+Lslavery &+Yfor this city is well renown for its slave trade. The walls on
&+Yeither side of the gate are lacking indeed for they are kept up by mere bamboo
&+Yand clay. Those walls, however, serve their purpose. Guards constantly keep
&+Ywatch within the city limit, however, they try to keep out of sight. The&+b night
&+Yskies can bring a &+cchill&+Y, quite a contrast to the desert's &+rscorching &+Rtemperature
&+Yduring the day. There is no escaping the sun as it beats down from the sky.
&+YThere are a number of things that sets this city apart from all the others. It
&+Ylies within the desert for one. It has almost no order, unlike the great city of
&+YTharndia. It tolerates all the races, even the dreaded undead have found a
&+Yhome within these walls. It has a great &+bdock&+Y, providing the city with a lot of
&+Ytrade and much needed revenue. It has a privileged bourgouise class of
&+Ymerchants that come to trade on a regular basis at the city's &+Lbazaar&+Y. It has a
&+Yflux of merchants that have set up shoppe and trade their merchandise at a fair
&+Yprice, merchandise that can not be found anyplace else. There are rumors that
&+Ythis city even hosts a great &+Ltower&+Y of &+mmagic&+Y, however, it isn't known whether or
&+Ynot that this is true, since only a few will ever see it if it exists. The
&+Yexpanse of land that this city takes up is enormous, rivaling the truly great
&+Yones. This entire city is controlled by the Sultan. Stepping foot beyond these
&+Ygates places your person into his domain. A domain that is troubled by
&+Yfeuding &+rwarlords&+Y of the&+B great houses&+Y of the city. The wind picks up, sending
&+Ysand into the air. &+ySandstorms&+Y sometimes hit the city, however, most of the
&+Ypopulation of the city are too poor to have shelter, so they must suffer. With
&+Ythis city's great wealth, it is still infested with poverty. A great many of
&+Yits patrons are &+mpoor&+Y. As always, the rich get richer while the poor get poorer.

&+YBefore the Sultan's Palace&n~
   Above, guards can be seen pacing about the parapets, watching and trying to
stay alert. The walls are made of wood and brick, it would set ablaze easily
if a well placed torch found its way to it. But the marksmanship of the elite
patrols are unmatched, hitting a bull's eye from a hundred yards out wouldn't
trouble them. The road takes a turn to the right, obviously, toward the highly
valued Oasis of the city. It has none of the problems the slums face, however,
the walls aren't crumbling, no refuse of any type is visible among the street.
Ladders lead toward the parapets above. The ladders are placed on either side
of the castle gate, which is just to the west. A portion of the walls are left
open to the sun, allowing the guards a good view of incoming visitors, and
would allow a strict advantage point if the gate happened to fall, they would
have a staggering amount of weapons at their disposal to vanquish the enemy.
Boiling grease among them, the grease could cover the entire area, burning
flesh and disintegrating armor.

Within a&+y Ordinary &+WWhite Washed &+LDwelling&n~
   Citizens of this desert city have many different &+rreligions&n, some believing
in the &+Ldark gods&n, others quite content believing in the &+Wgood gods&n. However, the
majority of the people within this city are pagans. &+WLuncaster&n, the founder
of the Order of &+LChaos &nand &+rHavoc&n, believes in darkness. Huge sculptures have
been created by him in order to progress his enrollment of fellow citizens,
and to leach money from them. These huge creations of clay sit in all corners
and spaces in the house. Some of them are decorated with ornate jewelry.
Paintings portraying his version of the history of his gods are hung on the
walls. A huge &+ccircular &+ytable&n for dining remains in the center of the room,
obviously not used in quite some time. It isn't difficult to tell, but this
isn't a house to live in, but merely for show, to collect &+bmembership dues&n and
to entice new members, to otherwise duke them into joining this little club.
Although the &+YSultan &nhas no qualms anyone or any organization within the city,
he often keeps tabs of any large organization such as this one.

The &+LShoppe&n of the &+WMerchant Lord&n~
&+L   Who said fat merchants can't be choosy, well this one can be about his
&+Lwomen. Scores of women await the loving of this fat merchant for one simple
&+Lreason, he pays for it. That's right, with success comes pleasure, the type of
&+Lpleasure that only money can buy if you're as ugly as sin. A huge, erect, pole
&+Lstands in the center of the room supporting the tent itself, with long wires
&+Lheaded in six different directions for additional support in upholding the tent
&+Lalso. Much of the furniture in this tent has some sort of dirt, or sand upon
&+Lit. There are no cobblestones or any type of flooring within the room. One
&+Lwonders how this man became a success, o let me tell you why. His mother was a
&+Lhooker, his father was a gambler, and his siblings were players. As a kid this
&+Lmerchant was actually skinny. He grew up on the streets and became street
&+Lsmart, and made many connections. Through these connections he's managed to
&+Lcome up with some suppliers, and some customers. He's become a very successful
&+Lmiddle man in recent years, and with success comes food, a lot of fatty food.

Before the &+yTent &nof a &+rWeapons Master~
   Most soldiers of fortune do not get a chance to retire, for most of them end
up dead. Mercenaries are common place within this city, however, the mercenary
that resides in this tent is very different from most, he's older and still
alive. Years of wielding a variety of weapons has taught this mercenary much
about weapons. This large tent has a variety of racks with many a type of
weapons hanging on them. A huge pole in the center of the residence upholds
the tent itself, and the pole stretches twenty feet in the air. This tent is
just one big room to live in and does not have a bedroom, living room, nor
kitchen. Mathanyal is one of the most skilled warriors within the city, if there
is a challenge to overcome, an enemy to vanquish, he could do it easily. The
battle scars are numerous and are evident on him.

&+W   These chambers are elaborately decorated. It is said that the income that

&+Wfrom &+YVenan &+YTrut&+W. They have brethren in many of the major city's, however they
&+Wchoose to remain anonymous. Most of the order spend their time meditating or
&+Wreading as many books as time allows. This order is lead by a few elite,
&+Whowever they are not considered to be above the others. In each of the major
&+Westablishments there is a bishop of some sort, within &+YVenan &+YTrut&+W walls there is
&+Wa high bishop. This bishop is responsible for controlling and disciplining the
&+Worder to the standards that it must maintain. The high bishops are held
&+Waccountable for each of the order within their jurisdiction, so if one would
&+Wact inappropriately it would reflect badly upon the bishop.

Inside a &+yTowering&+Y Lighthouse~
   The boards used for the floor within this lighthouse seem old and
withered do to weathering. A little trapdoor remains in the middle of the room.
An iron rod handle makes opening the trapdoor from within the lighthouse simple.
Large wooden beams sprout towards the ceiling in order to support it. There
are eight beams in all, one for each small corner of the lighthouse since the
lighthouse is in the shape of an octagon. A large case with a lantern and
mirrors on either side of it provide the necessary light to guide ships in late
at night. A large bell rests next to the case on a wooden bench. The smell
and sounds of the ocean provide a relaxing atmosphere. It is important that
there this station be manned at all times, which is why there are always two
lighthouse sentries stationed here at all times, both watching themselves to
keep themselves awake and the high seas.

&+bthree docking areas, this road is almost always packed to capacity. Sailors
&+band merchants alike push along the wide road, making their way to or from one
&+bof the countless ships that are moored nearby. Massive buildings line this
&+broad, from warehouses to filthy ale rooms. Most are in a poor condition,
&+bhaving long since succumbed to graffiti and corrosion. Those owned by powerful
&+bmerchants appear to be well cared for however, still clean and guarded around
&+bthe clock by armed mercenaries. It would be unwise to enter these docks, simply
&+bbecause they've been given orders to chase off anyone who is foolish enough to
&+bapproach. These mercenaries could care less if they're forced to kill, all
&+bthat matters to them is getting paid, and they'll do anything have that happen.

&+ydamp. A large boarded up window would allow air to circulate, but it is
&+yhowever, boarded shut. Spots of &+rblood&n &+ycover a plank a corner.

permits for docking in &+YVenan &+YTrut&n must come here, as well must anyone who
wishes to transport passengers or goods. The royal banner of &+YVenan &+YTrut&n hangs
from the western wall, marking this place as an official representative of the
king and his family. Maps of the surrounding lake, and of the docks themselves
fill up the rest of the walls, leaving barely any room for the few lanterns

Before an &+yEncampment&n~
   The desert city needs food to survive. Those who cannot seek food within the
city often come here to fish for something to eat. They usually find plenty
of fish along with anything else that inhabits these waters. The sea is
plentiful with things to eat. The fisherman encampment to the east is
enveloped with a number of city dwellers that come here often enough to set up
a small tent of some sort. There are a great many fishing poles resting here
and there a long with a few accessories here and there. The docks is the
first place the great many merchants that visit the city see first, however,
the more reputable merchants dock at the larger docks within the city.

&+yvery well. The wooden boards that create the deck are of the strongest oak.
&+yThe beams upon below the deck, upholding it are cleaned on a regular basis to
&+yensure slime and algae to not plague it.

&+ythis dock has been constructed to deal with those ships designated for

&+ylarge crowds of passengers to be escorted along its length when the ships
&+ydock. The docks are equipped to handle ships on either side, allowing twice as
&+ymuch traffic to come through. During the high tides this dock has a number of
&+yproblems docking, since it's the lowest of the three. Passengers often times
&+yget there feet wet, even though they try very hard not to.

Before a Looming &+LStone Tower~
   This tower stands out in the desert, for it is huge. The cold cobblestone
road leads right along the entrance to the cold tower of magic, providing easy
access for the students and teachers who dwell within. The tall tower is quite
old from its appearance, perhaps one of the first structures to be built within
this desert city. It is similar to a small keep, having been constructed from
massive stone blocks cut from the mountains far to the west. Strange gargoyles
have been positioned on various ledges along the academy's exterior, their
twisted visages glaring down at anyone who passes by. This structure contains
one of the greatest collection of wizards and magical tomes anywhere within the
realms, perhaps even on par with the elven Towers of High Wizardry. The few
windows that are visible have been covered with thick crimson curtains, making
it impossible for anyone to peek inside.

An &+LArched Entrance&n to the &+WHigh Tower&n~
   The entry room into the dark tower is quite impressive, consisting
of a wide hallway and several carved arches. The builders resources must have
been a lot to have been able to construct such a design. The floor is carpeted
with thick golden rugs, which lay securely over a polished wooden floor. A
long hallway leads further north into the academy, while a heavy doorway leads
eastward, back into the desert sand. Only fools would enter this tower
uninvited, for who knows exactly what evil awaits those inside who are not
welcomed. This powerful tower of magic was built ages ago when the city was
first born, as refuge for those renegade wizards who sought to practice their
forbidden art in safety, if ever there is a place for their kind.

A Narrow &+LStone Corridor~
&+L   The walls of this wide hallway have been covered with a thick plaster,
&+Lone which is rough to the touch. This whitewash affect gives several different
&+Lswirling designs, making a rather plain wall look interesting.  The occasional
&+Lpotted plant can be seen pushed against the walls, evenly spaced to give off a
&+Lfresh forest-like scent. Instead of lamps or torches, the hallway is being
&+Lilluminated by several bobbing globes of magical energy. This mage light is
&+Lquite efficient, lasting for several days before needing replacement. The pale
&+Lsilvery light is more then adequate at lighting this whole area, keeping the
&+Lhallway free from any shadows. Sounds easily echo within this corridor, for
&+Lno spell has been laid to forbid it. Runes are slightly visible on the walls,
&+Leven though they are whitewashed, however, it's impossible to read them.

A &+bFisherman Encampment~
   Sounds of fisherman in the distance casting their reels and setting up
equipment can be heard. Shouts of surprise and alarm at catching something is
usually heard every so often. There are a great many fisherman within these
parts, all searching for something to eat. A great many people go hungry in
the desert city, often because they're too poor to buy food. The sea has
large quantities of food ready to be taken. The tents constructed here have
been so with haste and carelessness, they could easily blow down in a desert
storm. Shipmates from the docks often take a brief tour of this place and are
looked down upon by those who dwell here.

The &+LChambers &nof &+LFhgoo Evileye&n~
&+L   Since when have necros lived a life of luxury. These chambers are
&+Lfitting to resemble a cemetery. Torches provide light and hang from the walls.
&+LThe chamber has two levels, with the center level in the shape of a square and
&+La foot below the other level. Both levels have stone tiles for a floor. The
&+Lwalls reflect no torch light, which gives them a darker feel for there is no
&+L&+Lway to determine what they're made of. An altar of blood remains within the
&+Llower level of the room within the center of the square. The altar has atop of
&+Lit a sacrificial dagger and a scroll of sorts. Blood outlines the rims of the
&+Laltar, around its hinges. The dagger upon the altar has a bone hilt with a
&+Lrazor sharp blade upon it, however, it has no blood traces.

An &+mArcane Workshop&n of the &+mWizard&n of&+m Varmith~
&+m   Huge shelves hold books of arcane magic that have taken centuries to
&+mproduce. Varmith was the younger son of a grand sorcerer of the highest
&+morder. His father served the Sultan as his right hand advisor, magician, and
&+mfriend. He continued to serve him until his untimely death while his son was
&+msti&+mll in his youth. The academy of magic gladly took the son of the most
&+mpowerful magician within the kingdom under it's wing. This was thirty years
&+m&+mago and since that time Varmith has had enough time to practice and master his
&+mmagic. He is a teacher for the academy that took him in. Magic is his life,
&+mfortune, and his love.

&+LThe Top of the Dark Tower~
THIS ROOM NOT USED
   A stone tiled roof such as this allows runes of protection to cover all of
it. These runes are necessary to prevent water from leaking into the ceiling
and down through the rest of the academy. The runes will never run dry, never
to dry out of magic. From this vantage point all of the city is visible,
either by magical means or good engineering it is hard to tell.  The center of
the city, the castle of &+YVenan &+YTrut&n, is to the southeast. The city's barracks
and stable is barely visible overtop that. It is rumored that the magic users
had a hand in building &+YVenan &+YTrut&n centuries ago, however, dwarven and human
engineers took the credit readily.

&+yA Massive Bakery~
   The pungent scent of fresh bread and pastry wafts through the air,
calling out to those who pass by the sturdy wooden door leading into this
bakery. A glass windows in the western wall looks out to the road that runs
along the bakery's entrance, providing a great deal of sunshine during the
later hours of the day while the sun is setting. A few simple lamps have been
attached to the whitewashed walls, providing illumination during the early
mornings when the bakery first opens. Several tables and baskets are scattered
around the room, each holding a wide assortment of baked goods. To the east,
massive stone baking hearths can be seen, each providing enough room to bake
dozens of bread loaves.

An Entrance to a &+yLarge Tent~
   The Lone Desert Star is spot for the influential nobles and merchants that
can afford the finest in wine and food. The entrance speaks of high social
standings. No expense was spared in furnishing this Inn, with its richly
crafted wooden paneling that covers the entrance walls. Imported brass
lanterns with etched glass covers all illumination as well, casting their soft
glow over the crimson carpeting and oaken cloak rack. The fine scent of
imported tobacco smoke and roasted pheasant fills the air, combining with the
low murmur of patrons, to create a relaxing atmosphere. Sounds and smells of
celebration come from within the inn. This is a hot spot for all. It attracts
a great number of people at first glance as they enter the city.

&+ypungent scent of old ale and sweat. The common room is quite elegant,
&+ydecorated with tasteful art and expensive rugs. Several round wooden tables dot
&+ythe room, each one providing enough seats for five individuals. The fresh
&+yscent of smoke wafts up from a nearby fireplace, which crackles loudly near the
&+ysouthern wall. Tapestries and paintings hang from the wall, most depicting
&+ydesert nobles in different states. Some of are royal hunts and others
&+yof massive parties. It is quite obvious by the decor, only the rich are
&+ywelcome here.

&+yiron stove here, sending up an aroma that can set anyone's mouth watering.
&+yPots and pans hang from the ceiling and walls, each one scrubbed perfectly
&+yclean. The floors are of polished wood, the shine coming from them hinting
&+ythat they are scrubbed daily. Three open windows let the collected steam and
&+ysmoke waft from the kitchen, allowing the room to stay somewhat cool despite

The &+gReception Area &nof the&+W Lone &+YDese&+Wrt St&+Yar~
&n   The &+yfloor&n has been constructed using lumber boards with the measurements
of three by six. A number of these strong boards have been nailed onto the
frame of the building to ensure stability. The desk, couches, and chairs all
within this room rely on the strength of the craftsmanship of the floor. The
couch sits off in the left hand corner of the room next to a large open window.
In front of the couch lays a table of sorts for the placement of morning brews
such as &+Ycoffee&n and &+mtea&n. On either side of the couch are small wooden chairs.
The reception desk is in the northern corner of the room, while the hallway
leading towards the comfortable rentable rooms remains behind the desk. The
sounds of cooks and maids are sometimes audible early in the mornings, aside
from that, not much else gets within ear shot within these walls, otherwise
guests would be very displeased to hear a noise in the middle of the&+L night&n.

&+r   The Commander of the armed legion of Venan Trut&+r resides here. Mounted
&+rabove the doorway to his domain is a plaque reading 'God Save the King of
&+rKerristone' Only a few within the system of command are qualified to fit
&+rthe position of Supreme Commander of Venan Trut's&n &+rforces, however, there can be
&+ronly one such commander and Commander Yugly has neither been challenged nor
&+rdisputed for his position. This commander has seen Venan Trut&n &+rthrough the
&+rtroubled times as well as the peaceful times, as a soldier and a commander.
&+rIt is rumored that the commander has a few war prizes that he's kept over the
&+ryears, war prizes such as skulls and scalps. Most of the Nobles within the
&+rthe city fear his wrath and avoid him whenever possible.

A Lightly &+yPebbled &+LGr&+ga&+Lve&+gl&n Road~
&+y   This lightly pebbled road cuts along the northern cliff of the desert city,
&+ywinding its way along the cold stone like a vicious desert snake. Sand blows
&+yin small patches along the walkway, but most is kept from the city by the
&+ywalls and special barricades that line its perimeter. Squat huts and clay
&+yhouses of a varying size have been built along the road, taking up every
&+yavailable space and leaving little room for alleys and yards. The occasional
&+yhardy shrub grows up from the dry ground, but for the most part this region
&+yis barren of plant and animal life. Only the tiniest pebble stirs here, as the
&+ywind gently blows it along the winding desert city tracks. During the daytime,
&+ythis is the most blistering part of the city, and during the night it could be
&+ymistaken for a barren wasteland, truly the most vacant section of the city.

A &+yLi&+wg&+yht&+wl&+yy&n &+yH&+Lu&+ye&+Ld&n &+LCobbles&+yt&+Lo&+yne&n Road~
&+y   The stones have a light red color to them. More than likely the stones
&+yhave a great deal of clay within them. Some of these stones were in fact created
&+yby being glazed by extremely hot furnaces from within the city. This street
&+yis very wide, simply because it is frequented the most by many different races
&+yof many different lands. This section of the city, if there could be
&+yone, is the center. Alongside either side of the stone road tents are set up to
&+yhouse the nomads that frequent the city. Most of these nomads stay no more than
&+ya few months, some much briefer. Sounds of city life fill the air during the
&+ydays while, however, during the night only the slave traders are active,
&+yselling their merchandise. Slave traders come from all over the lands to trade
&+yhere, for it is well known that nearly no other city would allow such an
&+yinhumane business within its walls.

A Narrow &+LCo&+wb&+Lbl&+yestone &+yR&+Lo&+ya&+Ld~
   Cobblestones make up this road. The Sultan made this road out of this
easily obtainable stone because it's easy to maintain and it's very cheap.
Caravans and travelers can walk a little more easily than if the Sultan had
not thrown this cobblestone onto the desert. These stone allow for simple and
easy traveling. There are tents on either side of the narrow road. Nomads have
set up their tents in one of the most vacant parts of the city, and appreciate
their solitude more than most, they simply do not want to be disturbed. The
night air is especially cold in this region of the city, for it is the lowest
part. The cold night air settles all too readily here, the situation of the
cliffs sees to that. There are no posts, there are no lanterns, so the night
must be real dark, with only the moonlight to keep one company.

A Sandy &+yDesert &+LBazaar~
   Laid deep within the sand are stones that are able to support and stabilize
the weight of many caravans. These caravans house many merchants and
prospective buyers. Despite the city's devious nature, this is a somewhat
honest market. Those who buy, get what they pay for, whether or not that
merchandise is valuable is another question. Huge tents house many rich
bourgeoisie and many smaller tents house the commoners. A few stone buildings
shelter those who have been within the city long enough to amount a large
fortune and the time to construct their own dwelling. Sounds of merchants
dealing fill the air. The wind often picks up and blows the sand into the air,
creating a small sandstorm of sorts. During the day, when activity is at its
highest, the sun beats down all who are here to shop.

A Winding &+yDu&+Ln&+ye Trail~
   Tents on either side of this street are spread apart to allow for traffic
to smoothly traverse from one section of the town to the other. The tents
house some of the slave traders and slaves alike that will participate in the
slave trades within the city. Guards are kept nearby each tent to insure
proper behavior of each of the slaves within the tents. Tall poles with
torches on top provide light for the night in order for the trading to continue
for the later part of the evening. It is rumored that millions of slaves have
been bought or sold within these slave markets, which would make it the largest
of all time. If it weren't for the small trail of cobblestones laid many years
ago, this trail would not be traversable by anyone, let alone merchants with
caravans full of slaves.

&+Lare answered swiftly. All around the podium, sand envelopes the area, for this

&+ySmokey &+gTap Room&n of the &+yOne A&+Lr&+ym&+Led&+Y Dwarf~
&+L   Tables are numerous, chairs are plentiful, customers are everywhere. The
&+Lonly thing keeping this tavern from becoming great is the quality of the
&+Lcustomers and the location of this business in a desert full of nomads and
&+Ltyrants. Stains on top of the tap floor are from either from lousy dancers or
&+Ldrunk dancers. On the outside of the tap floor are huge cobblestones that have
&+Lbeen embedded into the sand below to allow for stable footing along within the
&+Lbar. A huge counter remains in the western corner of the room. Within the
&+Lcenter of the counter an opening opens up for customers to head upstairs to the
&+Lrooms for rent, once they have paid of course. Fights often break out here,
&+Lwhich is the reason behind the two burly bouncers standing side by side by
&+Lthe hearth in the far northern section of the room, however, these fights often
&+Lend abruptly as they're tossed out onto the street and onto their asses.

&+L   'If you've got guts, I'll gut you.', reads the sign hanging on the wall, or
&+Lwhat's left of the sign anyhow for the sign is dangling on a loose wire as it
&+Lsways this way and that. The sign is cracked, stained, and has nearly fallen
&+Loff the wall. This tavern has a bad reputation within the city, in a city
&+Lwhere bad is good and worse is merely child play. Many mercenaries have been
&+Lknown to finish off their marks in their time of weakness here, when they're
&+Ldrunk. This tavern is owned by an one-eyed hill dwarf, which has been thrown out
&+Lof his clan in disgrace. Rumors are numerous just exactly why this hill dwarf
&+Lwas been banished from his homeland, however, none can say for certain.

A Sandy &+yDesert &+LBazaar~
   Laid deep within the sand are stones that are able to support and stabilize
the weight of many caravans. These caravans house many merchants and
prospective buyers. Despite the city's devious nature, this is a somewhat
honest market. Those who buy, get what they pay for, whether or not that
merchandise is valuable is another question. Huge tents house many rich
bourgeoisie and many smaller tents house the commoners. A few stone buildings
shelter those who have been within the city long enough to amount a large
fortune and the time to construct their own dwelling. Sounds of merchants
dealing fill the air. The wind often picks up and blows the sand into the air,
creating a small sandstorm of sorts. During the day, when activity is at its
highest, the sun beats down all who are here to shop.

&+YThe Throne Room of the Sultan&n~
   This is the sultan's throne room. There are very few people in the&+y city
who can ever say that they've seen this room. It is very difficult to procure
an audience with his &+mworshipfulness&n. If you have, then it usually means that
you have alot of &+Ymoney&n or are some sort of &+yhero&n to the land. There aren't
many heroes who would associate with this sultan however, since he isn't a
great man and is of ill character. He rules this city with an iron hand and
dealing with him is a &+rdangerous&n game. Within these walls he rules all, if he
decides to punish you, then he will punish you. If he wants to put someone to
death, he puts someone to &+Ldeath&n. It is a lonely job, perhaps he simply needs
a hug or something. A gigantic &+Ygold throne&n is in the center of the chamber to
the farthest wall south. Curtains laced with the &+Mroyal &ncolor purple line the
brick wall behind the throne. There are columns on eitherside of the throne
supporting the ceiling and the architecture.

A Winding &+yDu&+Ln&+ye Trail~
   Tents on either side of this street are spread apart to allow for traffic
to smoothly transverse from one section of the town to the other. The tents
house some of the slave traders and slaves alike that will participate in the
slave trades within the city. Guards are kept nearby each tent to insure
proper behavior of each of the slaves within the tents. Tall poles with
torches on top provide light for the night in order for the trading to continue
for the later part of the evening. It is rumored that millions of slaves have
been bought or sold within these slave markets, which would make it the largest
of all time. If it weren't for the small trail of cobblestones laid many years
ago, this trail would not be traversable by anyone, let alone merchants with
caravans full of slaves.

A&+y SideShow&n &+LAttr&+Wa&+Yc&+Wt&+Yion~
   This vast tent was built long ago, in a time when freaks ruled this city.
The wooden part of this tent is being chewed apart by termites, and the weather
has almost taken this vast tent down. The shelves are leaning towards the
ground and barely hold the weight put upon them. This palace, as called by
its owner Mercal, is the best thing within the city. Most of the people that
come to shop here are the type you wouldn't trust in a shower, when you drop
the soap. The floor has cobblestones for it, making it more stable and less
sandy than the streets of this desert city. There are a few windows within
this building, however, most are boarded shut to prevent people from breaking
into this place late at night, to do their shopping freely. Mercal, despite
the occasional break in, is quite successful in this venture of the business
world, for he is very adept in screwing friends and acquaintances alike both
for cash and sexually.

A Large &+yShoppe&n of a &+LWeapons Dealer~
&+L   Most soldiers of fortune do not get a chance to retire, for most of them end
&+Lup dead. Mercenaries are common place within this city, however, the mercenary
&+Lthat resides in this tent is very different from most, he's older and still
&+Lalive. Years of wielding a variety of weapons has taught this mercenary much
&+Labout weapons. This large tent has a variety of racks with many a type of
&+Lweapon hanging on them. A huge pole in the center of the residence upholds
&+Lthe tent itself, and the pole stretches twenty feet into the air. This tent is
&+Ljust one big room to live in and does not have a bedroom, living room, nor a
&+Lkitchen. Verdadd merely sells his goods here to make ends meat.

&+YA Circular Stairwell~
&+y   Those who use these stairs are headed to the upper levels of the palace,
&+ywhere most of the royalty sleeps in high regard. Unless so permitted by the
&+ysultan, anyone entering this staircase would be subjected to endless amounts
&+yof torturing, a slow and painful death for all to hear and take heed to.
&+yPsychological warfare, indeed. However, mostly the sultan's guard passes
&+ythrough this staircase, for it is believed that the sultan has a more secure,
&+yprivate means of entering his private chambers that even his closest associates
&+ydon't know about. The cold stone tile has a small layer of dust settled upon
&+yit, indeed this staircase is hardly used at all. There are no windows, but
&+ytorches flare every ten feet, just as one disappears another lights the way.

A Large &+LRound &+gFoyer&n~
&+L   Quills and other writing utensils lay onto of the administrator's
&+Ldesk. The desk has been magically constructed it seems. The magic that upholds
&+Lthe desk is the same that upholds the academy and this kind of magic doesn't
&+Lfade. The tiles that make up the floor seem to come alive as they act like
&+Ljello, and quiver this way and that. A window with a view of the outside city
&+Lallows for fresh air to enter the room, however, it is often wondered if the
&+Lwindow is really there for no citizen has ever claimed to have seen a window on
&+Lthe academy. A magically lit ball looks as though it is dangling down from the
&+Lceiling on a string, however, it is in fact hovering over thin air. A wand or
&+Ltwo are magically guarded within a sphere of crystal magic, a powerful magic.

  Magic from across the land come to this great study to learn arcane
knowledge and rehearse forgotten skills with each other. Many don't meddle with
anything out of their power to control, but there have been instances
resulting in a death caused by some power hungry wizard without any sense.
Books are stacked neatly upon shelves, the shelves line the room in a square
shape around a circular staircase. Everything a wizard could want lies within

&+ydock. The docks are equipped to handle ships on either side, allowing twice as

&+YA Palace Corridor~
   This stone corridor is narrow, just wide enough to fit three or four
people width wise, about six or seven feet. Sounds easily echo in here, a
nuisance to those who live behind the walls, and the clanking of metal is
especially annoying. Torches flare on the walls, sapping up much of the
oxygen within these enclosed walls. There are no very few windows in this
corridor, however there are some nonetheless. The ceiling rises up tent feet
high, and is a dome shape, a very common feature in palace and castle
corridors. Anyone traveling these halls can be heard coming a mile away. Even
the slightest noise by the stealthiest assassin can be detected, which is
an added bonus to the design of the palace, for it helps guards dispatch
would be assassins or thieves with ease.

&+yAlong the Cliffs&n~
   The tents below are populated by the lower class of this desert city. Not
many people who know the city well travel with the untouchables, however, they
always wear a smile upon there face and never race and eyebrow at strangers,
a nice place to disappear. The smell of campfires lingers in the breeze, the
smell of fresh meat is appealing to all those with nostrils. The slight breeze
that brings the scent of fresh cooked meat also stirs up the sand, creating
tiny dust devils. During the day, the sky hasn't a cloud to be seen, giving the
sun every chance to beat down from the sky. A huge tower looms to the north, it
would be easily reached from here, and over off in the distance the slave
markets are overheard. A small hill runs on a downward slope to the south.

&+y   A cold stone staircase is in the western corner of the room. The long
&+ycorridor finally comes to an end here as those who wander these halls are
&+ygiven a choice of going up or back to the northeast. The staircase leads to
&+ythe second level of the palace, where very few have seen. It is said the there
&+yonce was housed within these walls a treasure so great that those who set eyes
&+yon it were killed instant so as not to spread the word it even exists. The
&+ysultan is indeed a brute, and he would result to extreme measures such as
&+ythose to protect his fortune. In any case the guards the patrol these corridors
&+yat all hours of the day are more than enough to keep rogues from infiltrating
&+ythe palace walls. The corridor continues to the east while the staircase takes
&+ythose who desire to the second level of the palace.

&+yit seem as though this section of the palace has remained dormant for many
&+ydays or weeks. A small window to the west gives a great view of the surrounding
&+ycity. Tents have been set up on either side of the most traveled roads in the
&+ydistrict, when fires burn during the day, the smell, if anything at all,
&+yreaches the sultan's palace. Some great paintings and murals hang on the walls
&+yon either side of the corridor, almost as if this place welcomes visitors and
&+yguests, however, nothing could be further from the Truth. Sounds echo very
&+yeasily in this hallway, booted feet can be heard from every corner.

An &+bO&+ga&+bs&+gis~
&+b   The fresh water looks inviting. Thousands of gallons of fresh drinking
&+bwater sits softly in the sun for all who can afford it. The Sultan has a huge
&+bsupply problem, the intake of water into the city is far less than the
&+bconsumption. If the sultan is to maintain a prosperous city, he is going to
&+bhave to buy water from outside sources, very expensive. If there were someway
&+bfor him to buy water very cheap, he'd do it, otherwise he'll exhaust other
&+bmethods first. Nothing is impossible for a sultan, for sultans are the owners
&+bof the land, and accumulate vast wealth from those living on it. The hot
&+bdesert heat scorches the flesh during the day, and it is best only to expose
&+boneself to it briefly. Desert nomads who wander into the city often do so
&+bduring the night, for traveling in the desert is only possible by it. A few
&+bpalm trees encircle the oasis, stripped bear by camels. This oasis is also
&+brelaxing. Resting here would be a great idea if one was tired or wounded.

Near an &+bO&+ga&+bs&+gis~
&+y   This desert city has one great weakness, despite the Sultan's greatest
&+yefforts to strengthen his city, water. Living in a desert habitat makes one
&+ywatch what he wastes. The desert surrounds the city structures in this area,
&+yand this is one of the most heavily populated areas of the city. One reason
&+yfor this being, an oasis lays nearby. This oasis isn't the major source of
&+ywater for the city, however, whomever has enough money can allocate a spot to
&+ysupply himself with water from this oasis. One cannot freely walk up to this
&+yprecious supplier of water undaunted, for there are guards to protect it's
&+yoveruse. The sultan has been known on occasion to post bounties on those who
&+ysteal his precious water, without paying. The stones that make up the wrong
&+yare packed into the desert sand. During the night, travelers need light,
&+ytherefore, the sultan built an array of poles about twenty feet apart, each
&+ywith a lantern on top.

A Winding &+YS&+ya&+Yn&+yd &+YDune &+yTrail~
&+Y   Most tra&+yvelers of this dune are the hardened type that are quick to

&+Ytrails unprepared, o&+yr without street knowledge. Any commoner unaware of the
&+yunspoken code of respec&+Yt within these parts, caught in a situation where he is
&+Yaccused of lacking respect&+y to one who is aware of the code, will die a brutal
&+ydeath. The rumors that come f&+Yrom within this place are frightening. Wars over
&+Yturf and respect have been known&+y to break out. Two houses are now battling each
&+yother, although no one speaks of it&+Y, not even the sultan himself for he has no
&+Ypower to stop these two powerful force&+ys. The names of these guilds go unnamed
&+yto the average citizen of this desert cit&+Yy, however, their bloodshed does not.
&+YThe reasons behind the sultan not evoking hi&+ys voice and power to stop this
&+ybloodshed are not misterious but merely politic&+Yal. These two houses are
&+Yresponsible for supplying the city with much neede&+yd funds for the two houses

either side by steep, treacherous cliffs. These cliffs aren't climbable, and
a few have been seriously injured by falling rocks from above. Children like
to play on top of these cliffs, for them just finding a way to the top is an
adventure. There isn't much to the people of this small alcove, except that
they enjoy great diversions from time to time, and strangers bring such
diversions. Desert Nomads and merchants are welcome in this estranged part of
the desert city, just as any other outsider is. Most of the children run around
nearly bare skinned, if not for the a cloth around the loins they would be.
Small fires burn here and there and the smell of cooked meat lingers.

the desert city, just as any other outsider is. Most of the children run around
nearly bare skinned, if not for the a cloth around the loins they would be.
Small fires burn here and there and the smell of cooked meat lingers.

&+YA Castle Courtyard~
   A cobblestone path leads off from the street to the northeast, coming across
a barricade of tall iron fencing. Shaped like barbed spears, each post is
razor sharp, and could easily cut anyone who brushed against their edges in the
wrong fashion. The fence opens up onto a circular courtyard, complete with
thick emerald foliage and an array of flowering plants. Two marble griffons
guard the cobblestone path, as it cuts through the lush courtyard and leads up
towards the castle's main doubled iron-clad doors. The castle itself is quite
elegant, crafted from thick stone blocks in a picture of a rose. Ivy clings
its way up the sides, covering up most of the glass windows.

&+YThe Soldiers' Barracks~
   A set of iron door leads into the massive building which houses half of
castle's royal guard. The gray stone floor is perfectly clean, most likely
scrubbed clean daily by the rigid soldiers going under training within these
halls. Tapestries decorate the wall, some displaying acts of great courage in
all of the sultan's most grand of military operations. The art was obviously
commissioned by skilled craftsmen, with details going down to the facial
expressions of the soldiers as they throw themselves against the enemy in a
countless assortment of battle scenes. These barracks have seen better days,
it's obvious that those who live here care not whether they sleep in a bottle
of filth or in satin. There are no windows, so only a handful of lanterns must
keep this barracks lit during the night and during the day.

&+YA Palace Foyer~
   This gigantic welcoming chamber is suited for grand entrances. The wide
arch of the double doors to the north is wide enough to fit ten men abreast,
and taller than five men combined. The intricate designs on the masonry is
also a wonder, who could have carved such beautiful figurines in such strong
stone? Perhaps, by magic, or by dwarven hands was part of this castle built
with. The cold speckled marble tiles cast reflections easily, and are often
polished as much as six times a day. The ceiling above casts a great
reflection on the floor, with its many murals and paintings facing down,
looming overhead. The whitewashed walls are smooth to the touch. A grand
staircase opens up to the west, while hallways run west and south.

&+YA Palace Corridor~
   This stone corridor is narrow, just wide enough to fit three or four
people width wise, about six or seven feet. Sounds easily echo in here, a
nuisance to those who live behind the walls, and the clanking of metal is
especially annoying. Torches flare on the walls, sapping up much of the
oxygen within these enclosed walls. There are no very few windows in this
corridor, however there are some nonetheless. The ceiling rises up tent feet
high, and is a dome shape, a very common feature in palace and castle
corridors. Anyone traveling these halls can be heard coming a mile away. Even
the slightest noise by the stealthiest assassin can be detected, which is
an added bonus to the design of the palace, for it helps guards dispatch
would be assassins or thieves with ease.

people width wise, about six or seven feet. Sounds easily echo in here, a
nuisance to those who live behind the walls, and the clanking of metal is
especially annoying. Torches flare on the walls, sapping up much of the
oxygen within these enclosed walls. There are no very few windows in this
corridor, however there are some nonetheless. The ceiling rises up tent feet
high, and is a dome shape, a very common feature in palace and castle
corridors. Anyone traveling these halls can be heard coming a mile away. Even
the slightest noise by the stealthiest assassin can be detected, which is
an added bonus to the design of the palace, for it helps guards dispatch
would be assassins or thieves with ease.

A &+yDir&+Lt&+yy&n Hovel~
   Puddles of water pool up along the wooden floor, having collected after
the last rain. It seems to always be wet here, due to the half missing roof.
Even the part that remains still leaks. Foul garbage has collected in piles
around this small house, due to thee occupant's loss of hope. The bums and
street urchins that dwell here care little for life, spending no time cleaning
up after them. Rats can be heard scurrying through the walls, their sheer
number most likely uncountable.

   Tents line up side by side in this huge alcove of space, flanks on
either side by steep, treacherous cliffs. These cliffs aren't climbable, and
a few have been seriously injured by falling rocks from above. Children like
to play on top of these cliffs, for them just finding a way to the top is an
adventure. There isn't much to the people of this small alcove, except that
they enjoy great diversions from time to time, and strangers bring such
diversions. Desert Nomads and merchants are welcome in this estranged part of
the desert city, just as any other outsider is. Most of the children run around
nearly bare skinned, if not for the a cloth around the loins they would be.
Small fires burn here and there and the smell of cooked meat lingers.

&+yAlong the Cliffs&n~
   The tents below are populated by the lower class of this desert city. Not
many people who know the city well travel with the untouchables, however, they
always wear a smile upon there face and never race and eyebrow at strangers,
a nice place to disappear. The smell of campfires lingers in the breeze, the
smell of fresh meat is appealing to all those with nostrils. The slight breeze
that brings the scent of fresh cooked meat also stirs up the sand, creating
tiny dust devils. During the day, the sky hasn't a cloud to be seen, giving the
sun every chance to beat down from the sky. A huge tower looms to the north, it
would be easily reached from here, and over off in the distance the slave
markets are overheard. A small hill runs on a downward slope to the south.

&+yTent &nof the &+LSoothsayer&n~
   Mereer is one of the most respected women of her age in this community of
desert peasants. Her brow marks the wisdom of middle age, with as many wrinkles
as a woman twenty years her senior should have. Her long flowing shaggy brown
her has been unkept for quite some time, however, the most noticeable aspect is
the wart on the left side of her cheek. Those who are used to it often never so
much as glance at it, but those who have never witnessed such a thing often
stare long and hard at it, however, she pays it no mind. There are many things
strewn around the room, but a long sheet splits the tent in two equal halves,
one half for privacy and the other for guests. There isn't many other
soothsayers within a hundred miles of the city, which is why Mereer has an easy
time of it. A strong odor enters the tent from the outside, the smell of
fires roasting meat.

&+yTent &nof the &+yPeasant Elder~
   Morgian is the wisest of all the peasants living in this alcove, and the
eldest. His many years has taught him so many things that studying or traveling
the world could ever have done. His wisdom is renown even throughout the rest
of the desert city. It is said that in his earlier y ears he fought in many a
war, however, there are no visible scars on his person to show for it. His
tent is neatly kept, with nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary anywhere
to be seen. A small wooden desk with a candle on top rests in the north side of
the tent. Since this is one of the largest tents in the peasant alcove, the
wind beats down upon it without mercy, however, a large wooden pole has been
erected in the center of the tent to ensure stability. During the day, this is
the most active tent as the surrounding peasants come here before and after the
days activities.

&+LInside &na &+LMetal Shack&n~
   The winds outside gentle rock this metal shack back and forth, with a force
that creates a strange high pitched sound, the sound only the wind and metal
could make. It would be dark in here during the daylight hours if not for the
overwhelming number of holes and crevices in the shack's make. It is clear
that only a few people in the alcove even bother to use the shack, for only
items belonging to hard working men are to be seen here, pick axes, chains,
shovels, and iron hammers. Maybe, there is a mine or something close by. The
dirt is mushy, which is caused by the amount of moisture that clings to the
air, if only the sunlight could find its way in here in great amounts, it
would be dusty dirt and not a soggy mush, nor would the horrible stench
accompany it. The door to the shack leans crooked on its hinges, almost
begging to be fixed or put out of it's misery.

Before a &+LCollapsed Mine&n~
   This is one of the few productive mines in the region, however, all
production was effectively halted when it collapsed. Some say that this is
the work of a higher power, an evil one. One or two mine workers were still
inside at the time of the travesty, and many a men can be seen tossing rocks
and digging with picks to clear the way to the mine's entrance. However, with
all the activity, no one seems to have finished an engineering perspective
to use leverage as an added advantage to clearing some of the heavier ones.
A few ropes have been tied to metal spikes on numerous places around the
largest boulder. The ropes run up about ten feet before they're entwined and
hooked together to form a much thicker rope, making it ten times as strong.
The rope runs up to the cliff above, and might be latched onto something.
Clearly, the idea was to use some sort of great weight on the cliff above
to hoist this massive rock into the air, freeing and clearing the way of most
of the debris. It's a wonder why the thought wasn't followed through.

&+LA Treacherous Shaft~
&+L   It's clear that only the brave and those who have something to work for
&+Lenter here, this is no place for the light hearted, or women. Jagged rocks
&+Lare everywhere, tripping or stumbling in this shaft could result in serious
&+Linjury. Most everything in this shaft is wet and slippery, moisture lingers in
&+Lthe air, mixed with dust, making it difficult to breath. There is barely
&+Lenough distance between the ground and the ceiling to stand, crouching would
&+Lbe best. Without a lantern or something to lit the way, death is imminent to
&+Lthose who traverse here. Sounds echo steadily, if all is still for just a
&+Lmoment, one can hear a steady dripping sound, perhaps a cavern or running water
&+Llyes deeper in the caverns, fresh water is a treasure in this desert.

&+LA Moist Cavern~
&+L   Stalactites hang loosely from above, dripping water, forming puddles below
&+Leach. Moisture lingers in the air, making it difficult to breath hard. Sounds
&+Lecho easily in this cavern, making it seem as if it were informing some dark
&+Lfiend who lives under the earth of the presence of intruders, however, that
&+Lis not the case. The mind can start to play tricks on anyone who finds himself
&+Lisolated in this place for too long, which is why shifts are short and the
&+Lwork week extended to those miners who work here. Tunnels have been worked by
&+Lthe workers in two different directions, one tunnel starts on the northeastern
&+Lside of the cavern and runs to the north, while another starts some thirty
&+Lfeet to the left of it, and seems to run northwest. Lumber supports the
&+Ltunnels it seems, and doing a superb job. Picks and shovels lay sprawled across
&+Lthe cavern, as if men hastily dropped everything and ran.

&+LA Collasped Mining Tunnel~
&+L   Anyone wishing to traverse to the northern section of this shaft must forog
&+Ltheir plans. The cavern has collapsed. The wooden planks that flanked
&+Leitherside of the tunnel are nothing more than a heap of mass swallowed whole
&+Lby the earth. Just what could cause a strong piece of engineering to fail so
&+Lhorribly is wondrous. A strong cloud of dust lingers in the tunnel, as if
&+Lthis collapse happened just recently. There is no means through the tunnel,
&+Lunless hours upon hours are spent digging through the rocky refuse to the
&+Lotherside. Sounds come from the south, and a small hint of daylight is seen.

&+LA Collapsed Tunnel&n~
&+L   Anyone wishing to traverse to the northern section of this shaft must forog
&+Ltheir plans. The cavern has collapsed. The wooden planks that flanked
&+Leitherside of the tunnel are nothing more than a heap of mass swallowed whole
&+Lby the earth. Just what could cause a strong piece of engineering to fail so
&+Lhorribly is wonderous. A strong cloud of dust lingers in the tunnel, as if
&+Lthis collapse happened just recently. There is no means through the tunnel,
&+Lunless hours upon hours are spent digging through the rocky refuse to the
&+Lotherside.

&+LBefore a Long Shaft&n~
&+L   A huge shaft runs vertical downwards. The jagged rocks that encircle it
&+Lon all sides would make for a rough climb down. The sounds of &+Br&+bu&+Bn&+Wn&+bi&+Bn&+Wg &+bwater
&+Lroars through the mining tunnel, almost deafening. This must be what the
&+Ltwo houses of this desert city have fought over and spilled blood for, a fresh
&+Lwater source such as this could tap into untold riches and wealth in the
&+Ldesert. There is no visible means down. Except for the scaling the shaft,
&+Lwhich is nearly impossible, there is no other way down.

&+LA Jagged Vertical Shaft&n~
   This vertical shaft seems to have been naturally formed, though its walls
walls seem to have been carved with artificial handholds, providing a method
of traversing its length with heavy difficulty. The simple gray rock is
sparkled with the occasional crystal grain, creating a strange affect when
studied from the right angle. Besides the hand holes, the walls are rather
rough and marked, with jagged points which reach out to snag falling debris.

&+LA Jagged Vertical Shaft&n~
   This vertical shaft seems to have been naturally formed, though its walls
walls seem to have been carved with artificial handholds, providing a method
of traversing its length with heavy difficulty. The simple gray rock is
sparkled with the occasional crystal grain, creating a strange affect when
studied from the right angle. Besides the hand holes, the walls are rather
rough and marked, with jagged points which reach out to snag falling debris.

Before a &+bFlowing &+BUnderground &+bRiver&n~
   Nothing can stop the deafening roar that the river makes. Even one's own
shout cannot be heard more by he who shouts it. The cavern is only twenty
feet across, and the river takes up most of the space. The ledge of land before
the river is only a few feet wide, barely enough for a few people to stand on.
The raging river creates a white water rapid of sorts, clearly there are rocks
and other debris spread across the river's bed, just enough to create the
splashing that is the white water. The river must be at least ten feet deep,
where it runs to or how far is unapparent, however, taking the river
downstream to where ever it leads might be the only way out, simply because
the shaft above is a treacherous climb at best, if not impossible.

On a Soggy &+yMud &+LTrench~
    A rockslide has recently happened, for there are many rocks embedded into
the soggy mush that is the ground. The mush seems to suck feet into it as
easily as everything else, making trudging through this mush pit difficult.
A roaring river opens up to the south, vehemently moving downstream. This
treasure, the underground river, could amass great wealth to whomever controls
it, for in the desert, water is greater than gold. The two great houses of
the desert, and the sultan, struggle to find fresh water supplies within the
sultan's realm, to lessen the burden of trading for it.

A &+LHuge Lair&n of the &+rFire Wyrm~
&+L  Piles of bones are scattered about the cavern. Many of the piles are
&+Lfleshless, however, some have carrion eaters scavenging the cadavers for
&+Lanything they can find. Many of the bones have bloody rags still clanging to
&+Lthem, with many more still dented breastplates. Huge stalagmites hang down
&+Lfrom the cavern's ceiling, dripping water steadily. The cavern floor is
&+Lcovered in slime and refuse. An odd slithering trail made by some sort of
&+Lcreature slithers is visible, whatever creature made those tracks must be huge
&+Lindeed, and treacherous, as the piles of bones would indicate.&n

At the &+gHelm&n~
   It's too noisy out here, the elven captains like it nice. It is said that
an elven cruiser could sneak up on any enemy vessel in the dead of night and
take the ship in a matter of minutes. The magical masks that do this have
runes painted on them, allowing them to flap silently. The hull also has runes
painted on them, an elven magic that provides protection and stealth. During
the day these runes provide protection from enemy vessels, the magic provides
camelfauge so that anyone not looking for the ship will not see it. The deck
is large, large with alot of space. The masks are a medium size, not very
heavy. Elven sailors manage the ship for the captain, who can be found by the
helm, he shouts orders regularly.

&+YA Castle Courtyard~
   A cobblestone path leads off from the street to the northeast, coming across
a barricade of tall iron fencing. Shaped like barbed spears, each post is
razor sharp, and could easily cut anyone who brushed against their edges in the
wrong fashion. The fence opens up onto a circular courtyard, complete with
thick emerald foliage and an array of flowering plants. Two marble griffons
guard the cobblestone path, as it cuts through the lush courtyard and leads up
towards the castle's main doubled iron-clad doors. The castle itself is quite
elegant, crafted from thick stone blocks in a picture of a rose. Ivy clings
its way up the sides, covering up most of the glass windows.

   A fine whitewashed hallway wide enough for four men to travel abreast and
tall enough for a twelve foot ogre. Most of the honored guests who walk the
length of this corridor are anxious to be received on the other side. Servants
of every ethnicity scurry through the narrow hallway on some sort of task for
their beloved masters. It is here, in the very center of the sultan's castle
do the diplomats from neighboring countries meet, it is here that balls are
held and political scandals begin or sniffed out. A very dangerous place to
be for those who cannot hold their tongues or lie badly.

&+WA Huge Dining Room~
   A huge rectangle dining room is centered around a huge dining room table.
A number of chairs complement the size of the dining table, flanking it on
either side and at its ends. At one end would sit the sultan, next to his
beloved wife and most favorite concubine. At the opposite end would sit the
sultan's most trusted ally, the king of Andor. It is said, that the sultan
embraces the saying, "Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer."
Most of the talk that centers around this table is such trivial talk, however,
it is not of what is said, but what is read by those who hear it. Such talk
is very dangerous. Nothing of wars, politics, or trade is allowed within this
room: all important matters, but not quite as dangerous as the subtle talk
that, can topple any important figure, if misunderstood or misread by those who
hear, that envelopes this dining room chamber.

   The most noticeable aspect of this huge chamber are the beautiful tapestries
that hang down on all four sides of this square ball room. Many a different
make are to be found, crafted by masters of many different races depicting
their own heritage and cultural background. Dwarven artists depict battle and
courage above all else while the elven nation contrasts sharply with pictorials
of trees and the indigenous animals of the forest. Human paintings and murals
have a wide scope to them, and vary sharply. Some of these fine works date back
a thousand years, some are beyond priceless for they are the sole surviving
artifacts of cultures long since gone. The speckled marble floor makes great
for dancing and socializing. Most of the balls held here have esteemed
diplomats from sovereign nations both abroad and nearby.

&+yhouses of a varying size have been built along the road, taking up every
&+yavailable space and leaving little room for alleys and yards. The occasional
&+yhardy shrub grows up from the dry ground, but for the most part this region
&+yis barren of plant and animal life. Only the tiniest pebble stirs here, as the
&+ywind gently blows it along the winding desert city tracks. During the daytime,
&+ythis is the most blistering part of the city, and during the night it could be
&+ymistaken for a barren wasteland, truly the most vacant section of the city.

easily obtainable stone because it's easy to maintain and it's very cheap.
Caravans and travelers can walk a little more easily than if the Sultan had
not thrown this cobblestone onto the desert. These stone allow for simple and
easy travelling. There are tents on either side of the narrow road. Nomads have
set up their tents in one of the most vacant parts of the city, and appreciate
their solitude more than most, they simply do not want to be disturbed. The
night air is especially cold in this region of the city, for it is the lowest
part. The cold night air settles all too readily here, the situation of the
cliffs sees to that. There are no posts, there are no lanterns, so the night
must be real dark, with only the moonlight to keep one company.

&+YA Palace Corridor~
   This stone corridor is narrow, just wide enough to fit three or four
people width wise, about six or seven feet. Sounds easily echo in here, a
nuisance to those who live behind the walls, and the clanking of metal is
especially annoying. Torches flare on the walls, sapping up much of the
oxygen within these enclosed walls. There are no very few windows in this
corridor, however there are some nonetheless. The ceiling rises up tent feet
high, and is a dome shape, a very common feature in palace and castle
corridors. Anyone traveling these halls can be heard coming a mile away. Even
the slightest noise by the stealthiest assassin can be detected, which is
an added bonus to the design of the palace, for it helps guards dispatch
would be assassins or thieves with ease.

&+YA Large Preparation Room~
   This is where nigglenaggle gets busy. Nigglenaggle is renown throughout the
city as the greatest chef of all time. Gnomes make great any things if they
put their minds to it, however, many of them don't put their minds into much
else besides inventions and silly lifelong dedications of some sort. Niggle,
as he's known in the castle, is quite simply the greatest chef the Sultan
has ever employed and the most trustworthy as well. Gnomes aren't known for
there treachery. The Sultan likes to play it safe and he surrounds himself
with people he can trust the most, or least likely to betray him. Niggle
prepares the personal meals for the royals that visit the castle, as well
as the big man himself. It is said that Niggle can cook any meal from any
continent for any contingent. Niggle is great.

the air, with exotic dancers no doubt accompanying it. The blue veil to the

to run wild. Anything and everything could be happening, with the sweet scent
of perfume mixed with the mouth watering smell of roasted meat seasoned with
wine, lingering in the air. It isn't difficult to imagine the debauchery that
must be taking place inside that lair of fancies, where women must run half
naked giggling with men not far behind. The stories reach far and wide of the
indulgence of the lands highest lords with however many women they choose.

A &+bFisherman Encampment~
   Sounds of fisherman in the distance casting their reels and setting up
equipment can be heard. Shouts of surprise and alarm at catching something is
usually heard every so often. There are a great many fisherman within these
parts, all searching for something to eat. A great many people go hungry in
the desert city, often because they're too poor to buy food. The sea has
large quantities of food ready to be taken. The tents constructed here have
been so with haste and carelessness, they could easily blow down in a desert
storm. Shipmates from the docks often take a brief tour of this place and are
looked down upon by those who dwell here.

&+MThe Room of Pleasure~
&+m   Music fills the air. The scent of fornification is everywhere. Champaign
&+mbottles have been knocked over, lay opened half empty, and full upon desks
&+mchairs and cushions. Naked women, the ones not being humped, dance an exotic
&+mdance for their masters. Their lightly veiled outfits are see through, their
&+mscent intoxicating. This room is where all the girls give and boys play. The
&+msultan treats all his guests to this room, which makes him a very popular man.
&+mMost politicians have one weakness, sex. You get a good woman in bed with them
&+mand they become weak. Its been said that men talk in their sleep, perhaps this
&+mis all some sort of plan of attack by the Sultan to get the upper hand in any
&+mnegotiating. Whatever the case, the moans of pleasure fill the room.

A Narrow &+LCo&+wb&+Lbl&+yestone &+yR&+Lo&+ya&+Ld~
   Cobblestones make up this road. The Sultan made this road out of this
easily obtainable stone because it's easy to maintain and it's very cheap.
Caravans and travelers can walk a little more easily than if the Sultan had
not thrown this cobblestone onto the desert. These stone allow for simple and
easy travelling. There are tents on either side of the narrow road. Nomads have
set up their tents in one of the most vacant parts of the city, and appreciate
their solitude more than most, they simply do not want to be disturbed. The
night air is especially cold in this region of the city, for it is the lowest
part. The cold night air settles all too readily here, the situation of the
cliffs sees to that. There are no posts, there are no lanterns, so the night
must be real dark, with only the moonlight to keep one company.

A &+gShoppe&n of the &+yTra&+gv&+ye&+yli&+gn&+yg P&+ge&+yop&+gl&+ye~
   This is a &+gpleasant place&n. Tinkerers are a traveling group of people that
travel to many distant lands and see many different &+mcreatures&n. If anyone in
this entire city could answer a question concerning other places or things,
they could. The desert seems to amplify in intensity to the northeast,
becoming an open dune. It seems the tinkerers have setup camp outside this
dune, for what reason? Maybe they are deciding whether they wish to traverse
this great dune toward the infamous &+ymountains &nof&+r pain&n. The mountains of pain
is a twin of the &+ymountain &nof &+Bperil&n, both great mountains with completely
different atmospheres, however, they both bear the names synonymous with
&+Levil&n intent&n or&+r death&n. A large caravan has beem setup around a circle of
caravans, it is a shoppe, a &+yshoppe &nof a tinkerer, which is bound to be worth
visiting. There is an old saying, '&+WShop till'ya drop&n'.

A &+yFilthy Tent &nof a &+yP&+ge&+yas&+gan&+yt~
   The peasants of the city can afford very little. A tent such as this is
the bare necessity to live outside of the city exposed to the sun. Without a
tent, one would bake in the sun, making living outside of the city walls
impossible. There are small clothes scattered around a few blankets. A few
pots and pans litter the ground. All and all, not very much to see, peasants
live very cheap within the city and even cheaper outside.

Before the&+L Gates&n of &+gHouse &+rLo'Ushuur&n~
&+L   Two huge rusted iron gates are here. They are the entrance to the house of
&+LLo'Ushuur, the most powerful house within the desert city. It is controlled
&+Lby the powerful count Vernadad Lo'Ushuur. Vernadad isn't a native of this
&+Lland, it is rumored that he came from lands to the east, with a much
&+Ldifferent climate, however, in all climates money stays the same. It is said
&+L&+Lthat his family had vast sums of money. Just how they earned there money is
&+Lleft open for iterpretation. Vernadad came to this city some years ago and
&+Lbuilt a powerful house, a house powerful enough to overthrow the sultan some
&+Lsay. Vernadad's resources extend great distances and his influence can be
&+Lfelt all through the city.

A Large &+LShadowy Foyer&n~
&+L   This is the welcome chamber into the great house of Lo'Ushuur. Its founder,
&+LVernadad is shady. Not much is known about him except that he was once a son
&+Lof a rich man. How he came into the city is a mystery as well, however, he
&+Lquickly developed influence int he most powerful of places and where it
&+Lcounted most, with the merchants. Money is power and he quickly came into alot
&+Lof it with deals cut with these shady merchants that come into the city. The
&+Lmerchandise they sell is most likely hot, however, it doesn't matter. Vernadad
&+Lis a genius in small sells and transactions, and he has his own powerful
&+Lhouse to prove it. Lo'Ushuur is apart of much of the city's day to day life.

&+LA Dark Wine Cellar&n~
&+L   A great many barrels fill the cellar. These barrels are full of wine, this
&+Lis a storage chamber used by someone with a vast amount of wealth. Wine is
&+Lincredibly expensive out in the desert, an expensive luxury that nearly no one
&+Lcan afford. It would be a travesty if someone were to happen to all this wine,
&+Lthe owner might have a heart attack. It's value is immeasurable, if someone
&+Lfound out its whereabouts, they would surely seek to steal it. The sultan
&+Lwould confiscate such a treasure if he were informed of it's presence. Sounds
&+Lecho within this chamber, drops of water fill the chamber. It is very humid.

&+YA Desert Dune~

&+ythe night time could some large party traverse this desert. There aren't many
&+yanimals that could sustain themselves within these dunes, for there is little
&+ywater and food. A few of the smaller rodents have no trouble finding food.
&+yHowever, larger reptiles and animals prey upon them. The winding dunes seem

Inside a &+gTinker's &+yCaravan&n~
   The traveling people are notorious for their bright and eye bleeding
clothing that they wear, for it is eye wrenching to say the least. They are
a friendly people known for their pacifism and gentleness toward nature and
all living things. They believe in harming no fellow being, they run from
any fight they come across and some have even died without so much as lifting
a finger to save their own lives. There are many fruits and vegetables and
assortments of meals packed away in trays with a few dirty dishes in an open
barrel next to the entrance to the caravan, obviously meant to be taken out
and washed. Tinkers often take what they need with them when they travel,
which would explain why clothing and the bare essentials fill this caravan.

A &+YCliff&n before the &+yMountains &nof &+rAnquish&n~
&+y   The desert dune comes to an abrupt end before the Mountains of Anguish.
&+yLittle is known about the mountains, however, rumor has it that fiends dwell
&+yin it and that all who entered have yet to be seen again. Some tales even go
&+ydeeper, calling the mountains the lair of the denizens of the underworld,
&+ybound by some ward, waiting on those foolish enough to enter their accursed
&+ylair. Few believe such stories, despite this, nearly no one even comes even
&+ythis close to it, except for the fishermen that live by the sea to the east,
&+yand the desert nomads that roam freely through the desert. These nomads
&+yaren't bandits, despite what everyone thinks, nor are they scavengers, however,
&+ynot much is known about them, since they're rarely seen let alone conversed
&+ywith. The sultan once had it in his mind to gentle these nomads, little did he
&+yknow that they were bread warriors, fierce warriors at that. The sultan's
&+ysoldiers were squashed by a tiny band of these nomads, or so rumor has it.

A Small Slope in a &+yCliff&n~
   There is a small yslope&n of earth&n before the mountain. This slope of earth
seems peculiar and out of place, as if it were placed there somehow. The
mountain itself is rough and course and made or rock, while the mound of earth
is soft. There are &+yfoot prints&n leading toward the mound, they suddenly
disappear as if some magical force removed them. The mountain rises a great
distance into the air and the peak is surrounded by clouds, making it difficult
to graps the magnitude of it all. Some mountains have snow caps on them,
however, this one is in a dry climate. It is difficult to tell what sort of
animal life lives among the peaks of the mountain, mostly wild bears and
birds probably. The desert spans to the east and south, while a small camp
is just visible to the southwest.

A &+YCliff&n before the &+yMountains &nof &+rAnquish&n~
&+y   The desert dune comes to an abrupt end before the Mountains of Anguish.
&+yLittle is known about the mountains, however, rumor has it that fiends dwell
&+yin it and that all who entered have yet to be seen again. Some tales even go
&+ydeeper, calling the mountains the lair of the denizens of the underworld,
&+ybound by some ward, waiting on those foolish enough to enter their accursed
&+ylair. Few believe such stories, despite this, nearly no one even comes even
&+ythis close to it, except for the fishermen that live by the sea to the east,
&+yand the desert nomads that roam freely through the desert. These nomads
&+yaren't bandits, despite what everyone thinks, nor are they scavengers, however,
&+ynot much is known about them, since they're rarely seen let alone conversed
&+ywith. The sultan once had it in his mind to gentle these nomads, little did he
&+yknow that they were bread warriors, fierce warriors at that. The sultan's
&+ysoldiers were squashed by a tiny band of these nomads, or so rumor has it.

An&+y Encampment&n of the &+YSultan's Guard&n~
&+y   The sultan, as every sultan before him, takes no chances. He has sent his
&+yfinest &+Yriders&+y into the &+Yheart &+yof the desert to safeguard a valuable source of
&+cwater&+y, and to ward away the desert people, perhaps a vein attempt to send
&+ythem on their way. These soldiers are dressed in light &+Lstudded suits&+y perfect
&+yfor a mixture of riding and fighting. The longswords that they wear on their
&+ysides have the emblem of the sultan's &+Ypersonal riders&+y. The&+c officers &+yare easily
&+ysingled out from the other men, for their golden embroided capes declare them
&+yso as easily as if it were stamped on their forehead. The encampment looks to
&+yhave been up for quite some time, perhaps a month, perhaps a couple. The number
&+yof tents and horses suggests that at least three dozen soldiers are stationed
&+yhere. Caravan trails in the sand suggest daily association with the city to the
&+ysouth, perhaps shipments of fresh &+bwater&+y are sent daily.

In the &+YHeart&n of the&+y Open Desert~
&+Y   The desert sun beats down from the sky relentlessly. Very few creatures
&+Yescape its heat, even those who dwell underneath the ground feel it severely.
&+YThe desert's indigenous life struggles to survive during the day, for water
&+Yis scarce and plants are nearly nonexistent, for all practical purposes this
&+Ydesert is barren. During the night the temperatures drop sharply and many of
&+Ythe nocturnal creatures come out to feed themselves. One of the many mysteries
&+Yof the desert is how so many nocturnal creatures manage to feed themselves
&+Yso well on plants and each other alike, not only do they manage to survive, but
&+Ythey seem to thrive as well. The desert dune slopes in all directions, nothing
&+Ybut sand can be seen. Very few people know the secrets of the desert, and very
&+Yfew still could actually cross such a great dune as this.

&+yA Winding Dune Encampment~
   For most of the people who live here, life is wretched. If there's one thing
about sand, is that it gets everywhere. Beneath the ears, under the hair, in
the mouth, in the finger nails, and just about everyplace else as well. This
is the poorer section of the city where those without the means live. They all
seemed to have to become one great giant conglomerate where whom the richer and
even not so richer have forgotten about. Cut throats don't even bother to come
here, thieves either, however, there be rumors of gypsies in these parts. The
wind blows softly, picking up the sand and blowing it through the air, hitting
tents and people alike. The sun beats down during the day here, making it
scorching and terribly dry, damn near unbearable.

Before a &+ySandy &+YBeach&n~
&+y   This is the final slope of the winding dune. The breeze that comes with the
&+ysea gently stirs the air, bringing with it the cooler air above the water.
&+yThe sea is a great source of food, fish is a valuable commodity in the desert
&+ycity, which is why there are so many fishermen and boats to go with it. The
&+ydocks within the city house whatever is caught, and the fishermen are paid
&+ytheir weight in gold. The sea meets the ocean a few miles further to the east,
&+ywhich brings to the city more trade and prosperity. The sultan, of course, takes
&+ya percentage of all trade that takes place. A few pirates strike every so
&+yoften, since there aren't many ships of war nearbye. &+YFootprints&+y lead toward
&+ysome rocks toward the north. Very mysterious.&n

On an&+g Elegant&+W Elven &+GCruiser~
   It's too noisy out here, the elven captains like it nice. It is said that
an elven cruiser could sneak up on any enemy vessel in the dead of night and
take the ship in a matter of minutes. The magical masks that do this have
runes painted on them, allowing them to flap silently. The hull also has runes
painted on them, an elven magic that provides protection and stealth. During
the day these runes provide protection from enemy vessels, the magic provides
camelfauge so that anyone not looking for the ship will not see it. The deck
is large, large with alot of space. The masks are a medium size, not very
heavy. Elven sailors manage the ship for the captain, who can be found by the
helm, he shouts orders regularly.

On an&+g Elegant&+W Elven &+GCruiser~
   It's too noisy out here, the elven captains like it nice. It is said that
an elven cruiser could sneak up on any enemy vessel in the dead of night and
take the ship in a matter of minutes. The magical masks that do this have
runes painted on them, allowing them to flap silently. The hull also has runes
painted on them, an elven magic that provides protection and stealth. During
the day these runes provide protection from enemy vessels, the magic provides
camelfauge so that anyone not looking for the ship will not see it. The deck
is large, large with alot of space. The masks are a medium size, not very
heavy. Elven sailors manage the ship for the captain, who can be found by the
helm, he shouts orders regularly.

&+Y   Most tra&+yvelers of this dune are the hardened type that are quick to

&+Ypower to stop these two powerful force&+ys. The names of these guilds go unnamed
&+yto the average citizen of this desert cit&+Yy, however, their bloodshed does not.
&+YThe reasons behind the sultan not evoking hi&+ys voice and power to stop this

A &+yLarge Warehouse&n~
   This is where most of the fish caught for the larger merchandising guilds
are brought and processed. The amount of revenue that the guilds generate
brings smiles to the sultan because of the tax money he collects. The guilds
do not liked to be taxed, however, the sultan doesn't care. Money isn't the
greatest concern to the sultan, order is. Just having the guilds paying their
taxes gives the sultan some security. It gives the sultan a sense that his
word and authority are still respected, even in the larger guilds that could
possibly overthrow or undermine his regime. The stench of the warehouse is
almost unbareable. The materials used to build this warehouse looks done in,
and the machinery used to process the fish looks ancient.&n

&+yA Winding Dune Encampment~
   For most of the people who live here, life is wretched. If there's one thing
about sand, is that it gets everywhere. Beneath the ears, under the hair, in
the mouth, in the finger nails, and just about everyplace else as well. This
is the poorer section of the city where those without the means live. They all
seemed to have to become one great giant conglomerate where whom the richer and
even not so richer have forgotten about. Cut throats don't even bother to come

An &+yEnormous&+Y Desert Dune~
&+Y   Dunes have taken the lives of a great many unweary travelers. It is said
&+Ythat temperatures can escalate up to one hundred and twenty degrees. During
&+Ythe day, the sun beats down from the sky onto all living things in the desert,
&+Yanything caught in the sun's rays will bake if it's not sheltered. The only
&+Ything worse than the desert heat, is the desert cold. When the night skies
&+Yblanket the desert, the temperatures drop a good seventy degrees. Sand storms
&+Yhave been known to blow through this desert, causing many tents and constructs
&+Yto be ruined and lost. Scarabs and other vicious predators prey on anything
&+Ythat steps foot into this realm. It is said that many a nomad have succumbed
&+Yto a scorpion or snake bite after reaching help within the city. There aren't
&+Ya great many reasons to enter this desert dune, except to get to the otherside.
&+YIt is rumored, however, that a great tower of sorcery is hidden deep within the
&+Ydesert's center, protected by magic and powerful guardians.&n

&+yA Winding Dune Encampment~
   For most of the people who live here, life is wretched. If there's one thing
about sand, is that it gets everywhere. Beneath the ears, under the hair, in
the mouth, in the finger nails, and just about everyplace else as well. This
is the poorer section of the city where those without the means live. They all
seemed to have to become one great giant conglomerate where whom the richer and
even not so richer have forgotten about. Cut throats don't even bother to come
here, thieves either, however, there be rumors of gypsies in these parts. The
wind blows softly, picking up the sand and blowing it through the air, hitting
tents and people alike. The sun beats down during the day here, making it

Before a &+YGlowing Runestone~
   It is said that all things that come to pass and all things that ever will
does not matter, because it's all the same in the end. This can be attributed
to everything except magic. Magic is eternal, never ending. It was born with
the creation of the universe and will only end when everything is consumed and
it collapses within itself. One million years could pass, everything would be
changed, however, the glowing runestone that iminates in the center of this
desert dune will still be here, its magic as potent as ever. Nothing of the
physical world can altar its appearance, because it's a prodigy of magic.
It possess great power, one glance at it can enthraw almost anyone willing to
give in to its will. Armies could fall from the power endowed into it. Rivers
can run dry. Oceans can rise and fall and the sun and stars can all fade from
the sky from the power of this stone. Just to unlock its secrets is to uncover
something secretly hidden away.

&+L   This is a small secret chamber of the Order of Chaos and Havoc. Not
&+Lmany people get to see this side of the Order. Enrolling into the Order is the
&+Lonly way to see the othersides of those walls. Becoming a member is a
&+Ldifficult commitment, since it requires signing over all your assets. This is
&+Lmandatory since it shows a sincere to the standing of the Chaos and Havoc
&+Lorder. The Sultan has tried to infiltrate the order without success in the
&+Lpast, perhaps he's a little insecure about the extremity members are subjected
&+Lto. Extreme measures attract extreme people, zealots. A zealot is the type of
&+Lperson who does what he wants when he wants it for reasons totally partial to
&+Ltheir point of view with total disregard to anythin else. This probably scares
&+Lthe Sultan because coups are usually started with zealots or idealists. Thus,
&+Lone reason for secrecy, protection from the Sultan. There are other reasons
&+Lfor the need to keep operations quiet for the order, but fear is not one.

An&+Y Desert Dune~
&+Y   Dunes have taken the lives of a great many unweary travelers. It is said
&+Ythat temperatures can escalate up to one hundred and twenty degrees. During
&+Ythe day, the sun beats down from the sky onto all living things in the desert,
&+Yanything caught in the sun's rays will bake if it's not sheltered. The only
&+Ything worse than the desert heat, is the desert cold. When the night skies
&+Yblanket the desert, the temperatures drop a good seventy degrees. Sand storms
&+Yhave been known to blow through this desert, causing many tents and constructs
&+Yto be ruined and lost. Scarabs and other vicious predators prey on anything
&+Ythat steps foot into this realm. It is said that many a nomad have succumbed
&+Yto a scorpion or snake bite after reaching help within the city. There aren't
&+Ya great many reasons to enter this desert dune, except to get to the otherside.
&+YIt is rumored, however, that a great tower of sorcery is hidden deep within the
&+Ydesert's center, protected by magic and powerful guardians.&n

A &+LNarrow Passage~
   This is a narrow passage through a cliff. It leads to an encampment of
some sort, perhaps that of peasants. Not many nobles or those with means
come to this section of the desert city. It doesn't matter to anyone that
these peasants ahve to live the dirty low life, because they don't even exist
in the great scheme of the city. The wind blows hard through this narrow
passage, sending sand into ones eyes, ears, hair, and mouth. This is the only
way into the encampment of peasants, since it looks as if the cliff
surrounds the small dune encampment on all sides. During the nights these
peasants freeze their butts off, and during the day they cook under the sun.

&+yTent&n of the&+Y Wanderer~
   Eriic the wanderer has been many places in his long life. Everywhere from
Tharnadia to Tiamat to the Underdark. He is widely known throughout the city
for his charts and maps and adventure stories. His long flowing blond hair
does not reflect his old age, however, he is very old. The candle light is
barely enough to see the fine lines on his face, the wrinkles of old age. Many
of the common city dwellers come to see Eriic for advice to share his company.
Eriic enjoys company. Eriic enjoys telling stories even more. Most children
come to see Eriic if their parents allow them. Most children come to see Eriic
even if their parents don't allow them. He is known as the wanderer. The will
of this wanderer is to die of old age, never by the spear of another through
his gut or by famine or disease. His jolly laughter is legendary.

&+yTent &nof the &+BShaman~
   Shamans are a respected and feared class. They are in touch with the spirits
and possess incredibly potent magic. They are a unique class of individuals
who combine these magics with the power of the wildlife, making them very
dangerous if they chose to be. Shamans in this city are the healers of the
ordinary people, since most clerics won't even come to these desolate sections
of the city. Popular ones could collect a vast fortune if they chose by
taxing those who seek their services. Most individuals who come to see Ruffus
are seeking not healing, but reassurances that they have not contracted some
sort of disease. Unlike most shamans, Ruffus is a people person, dependent on
others for his sanity. Many shamans keep to themselves, Ruffus does not.

&+yA Winding Dune Encampment~
   For most of the people who live here, life is wretched. If there's one thing
about sand, is that it gets everywhere. Beneath the ears, under the hair, in
the mouth, in the finger nails, and just about everyplace else as well. This
is the poorer section of the city where those without the means live. They all
seemed to have to become one great giant conglomerate where whom the richer and
even not so richer have forgotten about. Cut throats don't even bother to come
here, thieves either, however, there be rumors of gypsies in these parts. The
wind blows softly, picking up the sand and blowing it through the air, hitting
tents and people alike. The sun beats down during the day here, making it
scorching and terribly dry, damn near unbearable.

A Large &+LWeapon Shoppe~
&+L   This is where Blackfoot does his business. Blackfoot was once a merchant
&+Ldealer in the great city of Tharnadia, however, his scandalous ways were
&+Lrouted out and and he was banned from ever dealing within the city walls
&+Lagain. He found refuge in the desert city under the sultan's irreputable
&+Ldelite in providing havens for the unwanted and dedicated who bring merchandise
&+Linto the city. Blackfoot was a deviant in Tharnadia but in the desert city
&+Lhe is a bigtime middleman for the Chaos and Havoc guild. It is here in this
&+Lroom where he orchestrates a great many deals that bring money to the guild and
&+Lto himself. There are weapons of all sort of make lining the walls.

Before a &+yPile &nof &+LRefuse~
   There are some who would say that the desert really sucks. Most people who
live within this desert city agrees. Sand gets everyplace. It gets in your
ears, mouth, hair lungs, pants, shoes, and anyplace else imaginable. Like a
big bluebird everyone wishes they can fly away from this place. The sand is
course, the sun is terrible and relentless, the people stink, the sultan has
a terrible temper and executes a lot of people, and only god knows what else.
The cannion walls surround this encampment of desert peasants. It provides
protection from the desert storms that often sweep the city. Most of those
who cannot afford shelter or someplace of their own live here. Sounds of
the desert city life can be heard barely. Occasionally the wind will howl,
creating an errie sound, as if something was pleading to be released from pain.

butcher most seek to butcher their meat. Hunters come here mostly, sometimes
little kids who've caught a squirrel or rabbit as well. Parnn is a nice guy
when it comes to butchering, he likes to hack meat. He'll do it for free as
well, if you've got a purdy mouth. His fees range widely depending on the meat
that needs to be hacked and chopped. The front of the tent is the only place
customers are allowed. It is rumored that the back is messy with animal limbs
and such and gruesome to set eyes upon. The stench is horrible, however, it
is quickly cycled out. The desert city needs butcher, Parnn does his job well.

&+mdance for their masters. Their lightly veiled outfits are see through, their
&+mscent intoxicating. This room is where all the girls give and boys play. The
&+msultan treats all his guests to this room, which makes him a very popular man.
&+mMost politicians have one weakness, sex. You get a good woman in bed with them
&+mand they become weak. Its been said that men talk in their sleep, perhaps this
&+mis all some sort of plan of attack by the Sultan to get the upperhand in any
&+mnegotiating. Whatever the case, the moans of pleasure fill the room.

A Winding &+yDu&+Ln&+ye Trail~
   Tents on either side of this street are spread apart to allow for traffic
to smoothly transverse from one section of the town to the other. The tents
house some of the slave traders and slaves alike that will participate in the
slave trades within the city. Guards are kept nearby each tent to insure
proper behavior of each of the slaves within the tents. Tall poles with
torches on top provide light for the night in order for the trading to continue
for the later part of the evening. It is rumored that millions of slaves have
been bought or sold within these slave markets, which would make it the largest
of all time. If it weren't for the small trail of cobblestones laid many years
ago, this trail would not be traversable by anyone, let alone merchants with
caravans full of slaves.

A &+rSparring&+r Chamber~
&+r   This is where the warriors pounce on one another. Secret gatherings such as
&+rthis are not all uncommon for secret guildhouses. Many of the houses house
&+rtheir own armies and private protection against whatever. The warriors here
&+rtrain and train and train, it's their lifestyle. They have many scars on
&+rtheir persons along with many bruises. It's a tuff life, becoming a harder
&+rand harder as each day passes. Their muscles are covered in sweat and some
&+rare missing many of their teeth. None of these guys are pretty, however, none
&+rof them really care. After taking a life most things seem trivial and after
&+rseeing many battles become permenantly depressed, such is a life of a warrior.

An &+LAntechamber&n of &+WLuncaster~
&+L   Luncaster, the founder of the order of Chaos and Havoc, sleeps here. This
&+Lis his private chambers away from the guild members and their politics. It is
&+Lhere that he finds solitude and confinement and time to for himself to develop
&+La sense of direction for the guild and its members. It is stressful to lead
&+Lanything or anyone and one needs a sense of himself to do so. Natural leaders
&+Lfind an answer for anything, even if it's not an answer people choose to
&+Laccept, which is why there are bodyguards around luncaster at all times. The
&+Lorder of Chaos and Havoc isn't as powerful as Lo'Ushuur, but it has its
&+Linfluence on the populous and its own personnel to draw from to protect its
&+Linterests. Luncaster was once rumored to be a cleric, mysterious.

An &+yEnormous&+Y Desert Dune~
&+Y   Dunes have taken the lives of a great many unweary travelers. It is said
&+Ythat temperatures can escalate up to one hundred and twenty degrees. During
&+Ythe day, the sun beats down from the sky onto all living things in the desert,
&+Yanything caught in the sun's rays will bake if it's not sheltered. The only
&+Ything worse than the desert heat, is the desert cold. When the night skies
&+Yblanket the desert, the temperatures drop a good seventy degrees. Sand storms
&+Yhave been known to blow through this desert, causing many tents and constructs
&+Yto be ruined and lost. Scarabs and other vicious predators prey on anything
&+Ythat steps foot into this realm. It is said that many a nomad have succumbed
&+Yto a scorpion or snake bite after reaching help within the city. There aren't
&+Ya great many reasons to enter this desert dune, except to get to the otherside.
&+YIt is rumored, however, that a great tower of sorcery is hidden deep within the
&+Ydesert's center, protected by magic and powerful guardians.&n

&+LA Huge Cavern filled with &+GPho&+gspho&+Gric &+LAcid~
&+L   This cavern circles around a large pool of phosphoric acid. There would be
&+Lno return for any fool dumb enough to fall in, they'd be killed in a matter
&+Lof seconds. The fumes from the acid fill the chamber, creating nausia and
&+Lirratable eyes, ears, noes, and throat. The rocky stalagtites hang from above,
&+Lcovered in moss. Water accumulates at the end of some of them and drips to the
&+Lground below, making the ground wet with accumulation. Sounds echo easily
&+Lenough, every breathe is audible. A green vapor rises from the acid, and
&+Leventually dissipates.

A &+yDir&+Lt&+yy&n Hovel~
   Puddles of water pool up along the wooden floor, having collected after
the last rain. It seems to always be wet here, due to the half missing roof.
Even the part that remains still leaks. Foul garbage has collected in piles
around this small house, due to thee occupant's loss of hope. The bums and
street urchins that dwell here care little for life, spending no time cleaning
up after themselves. Rats can be heard scurrying through the walls, their sheer
number most likely uncountable.

number most likely uncountable.

&+LA Huge Cavern filled with &+GPho&+gspho&+Gric &+LAcid~
&+L   This cavern circles around a large pool of phosphoric acid. There would be
&+Lno return for any fool dumb enough to fall in, they'd be killed in a matter
&+Lof seconds. The fumes from the acid fill the chamber, creating nausia and
&+Lirratable eyes, ears, noes, and throat. The rocky stalagtites hang from above,
&+Lcovered in moss. Water accumulates at the end of some of them and drips to the
&+Lground below, making the ground wet with accumulation. Sounds echo easily
&+Lenough, every breathe is audible. A green vapor rises from the acid, and
&+Leventually dissipates.

A &+yHidden&n &+LTunnel&n~
   There are puddles of water that have accumulated over the years. The muck
on the ground creates a sucking motion that makes walking in it difficult.
There are planks above that keep this hidden tunnel safe and secure. It's a
great height to the top, nearly twelve feet with plenty of space from side
to side. There is enough room here to move a small army. No sunlight will
ever reach this place, because it is hidden within the crevice of a large
mountain crevice. Where this small tunnel leads is a mystery, a mystery only
to be solved by following it to its conclusion, which is to the north. A few
snakes are sure to have taken residence in this dark damp tunnel.

A &+LHidden Abode&n of the &+LUnderground &+mMerchant Dealers~
   Merchants from all over this desert city find it difficult to sell their
goods. Day after day marketing their goods to the people of this city and to
those who live on the outskirts who decide to shop here. This is not a very
profitable way to sell their product, which is why some decide to smuggle in
a more valuable product. Some merchants opt to keep it legal, however, there
have been reports within the city of a few merchants brave enough to smuggle
contrabans. If it happens within the city walls, the Sultan is aware of it,
therefore, if it does happen, then the Sultan must condone it. Puddles of mud
have accumulated here and there, for this is a secret chamber hidden under
a mountain, the perfect spot to smuggle contraband.

&+m   Music fills the air. The scent of fornification is everywhere. Champaigne
&+mbottles have been knocked over, lay opened half empty, and full upon desks
&+mchairs and cushions. Naked women, the ones not being humped, dance an exotic
&+mdance for their masters. Their lightly veiled outfits are see through, their
&+mscent intoxicating. This room is where all the girls give and boys play. The
&+msultan treats all his guests to this room, which makes him a very popular man.
&+mMost politicians have one weakness, sex. You get a good woman in bed with them
&+mand they become weak. Its been said that men talk in their sleep, perhaps this
&+mis all some sort of plan of attack by the Sultan to get the upperhand in any
&+mnegotiating. Whatever the case, the moans of pleasure fill the room.

At the&+y Helm&n~
   The bare feet of the crew make some thuds against the planks of the deck.
A crew of twenty is required to operate this huge ship. The work never stops
on a ship at sea, which makes strong backs. Huge poles rise up toward the
sky, once the masts are up, with the wind willing, this passenger ship could
make great time in the open sea. The hull looks as though it needs a good
scrub down, as if it's been sailing hard the past few weeks. The deck, also,
needs a good cleaning, and many a ship hand are doing just that. The huge sails
that would catch the wind so vigilantly are tied down, so as not to damage the
masts or ship hand alike. A rail four feet high runs the perimeter of the ship,
as a precaution and something to hang onto for those landlubbers who feel the
need to vomit their dinner overboard.&n

masts or ship hand alike. A rail four feet high runs the perimeter of the ship,
as a precaution and something to hang onto for those landlubbers who feel the

On a the Deck of a&+y War Ship~
   The bare feet of the crew make some thuds against the planks of the deck.
A crew of twenty is required to operate this huge ship. The work never stops
on a ship at sea, which makes strong backs. Huge poles rise up toward the
sky, once the masts are up, with the wind willing, this passenger ship could
make great time in the open sea. The hull looks as though it needs a good
scrub down, as if it's been sailing hard the past few weeks. The deck, also,
needs a good cleaning, and many a ship hand are doing just that. The huge sails

&+LWithin a Dark Dank Dunnel~
&+L   There isn't a lot to see in this tunnel, because it is very dark. There are
&+Laudible sounds of running water off in the distance, perhaps an underground
&+Lstream of some sort. The sounds of dripping fills the cavern, forward and
&+Lback, it is difficult to tell where anything is coming from within this
&+Ltunnel, because sounds echo so easily. The tunnel isn't very high, maybe
&+Ltwenty feet in height and ten feet wide, just enough to fit a party through.
&+LLike many tunnels and mountains, there are sharp pieces of rock in nearly
&+Levery crevice, one slip or fall could be fatal. The limestone and granite
&+Lrock of the mountain is slippery and should be respected for it is worth
&+La great amount of money if mined.

&+LWithin the Abandoned&+C Mines &+Lof &+LKhul'Lor&n~
&+L   The number of years ago, perhaps a few decades, the great mage Khul'Lor
&+Lwas an adept at creating things and learning of new possibilities. This great
&+Lmage built a tower with the help of this mine, It funded the dwarven kingdom
&+Lto build a great tower and citadel in his name, where he resides now. The
&+Llocation of his kingdom is haunted now, with his spirit lingering in this life
&+Lfor all eternity. This mine was Khul'Lor's, now it is abandoned, left to the
&+Lunderworld. Little critters and worms have taken refuge under the mountain.
&+LEquipment and tools from the dwarven miners that worked in this mine are
&+Lstill here, rusted and unusable, but still here. The tunnel continues to the
&+Least and west, either direction similiar to the south.

&+L   Thri-kreens are insects. They are insects with many limbs and scales like
&+Lall others. Just like many insects, they breed unconditionally, as much and
&+Las fast as nature will allow. To do this, they must have control and order,
&+Land this is provided by the Queen Thri-kreen. This queen is the focal point
&+Lof all thri-kreen activity, it gives them drive and a sense that gives them
&+Lpurpose. The queen lays a great number of eggs and she is constantly at work.
&+LThe Thri-kreens must have taking refuge in this undermountain as protection
&+Lagainst the outside world, since it has been abandonded for a number of years,
&+Lvery few are even aware of its existence.

&+Lback, it is difficult to tell where anything is coming from within this
&+Ltunnel, because sounds echo so easily. The tunnel isn't very high, maybe
&+Ltwenty feet in height and ten feet wide, just enough to fit a party through.

The &+mMembers &+LMeeting Chamber~
   Noxxon has spent years building his empire. Since he first was a little boy
he always dreamed of being the bigshot. He's not quite the big shot he had
dreamed of, however, he exerts a lot of influence over the welfare of the
city. Noxxon smuggles drugs. It has made him a rich and powerful man. He has
the power to kill anyone and make their body disappear, well, nearly anyone.
The underground market place is controlled by himself, no other. He smuggles
other goods as well, like weaponry. This chamber is where his underground
smuggling group convenes and discusses the state of the guild. The welfare of
his baby is priority one, next to becoming all powerful. Maybe one day Noxxon
will knock off the Sultan, however, that path is painful and can lead no place.

Before a &+LNarrow Crevice~
&+L   The desert night sky provides a haven for creatures that are sensitive to
&+Lthe sun. &+mDrow&+L, in particular, have a terrible sensitivity to the sun. Drow
&+Lhave immense power, however, if they were caught out in the sun their power
&+Lwould diminish heavily. The desert night is extremely cold. The desert daylight
&+Lis extremely hot. It's hardly conceivable how anyone could live within a
&+Ldesert. Deserts are notorious for their lack of water, and a lot of effort
&+Lmust be placed in transition of it. A desert cliff above is the source of
&+Lfalling rocks. Wind blows above, sending sand flying only to land in eyes and
&+Lears. The rocks on eitherside of the ravine are impossible to climb, and a
&+Lnarrow crevice is visible within a part of the cliff wall, perhaps it could
&+Lhide something. There's no telling where the crevice leads too, however, it
&+Lmost likely leads to more desert. Theres something more here then can be seen.

A &+mSleeping&+L Chamber&n~
   Small beds are here to sleep on. The members of this guild, like all others,
need to sleep. The beds are just small composites of lumber and straw real,
not meant for convenience but rather to keep it's residents from the freezing
cold floors. The flooring is nothing more than some cobblestones and some
straight pieces of lumber. Quite cozy after awhile. A renegade or hideaway
like all of these merchants are could get comfortable after some time spent
here. The room is about twenty by forty, enough room to house a number of
members to this merchant guild. These merchants must be the tough type, maybe
waking them up in the middle of the night would be a bad idea.

might need armor. Armor is good, armor saves lives, and more importantly it
can make you some money. Adamantium is one of the strongest metals. It
makes great protection armamants such as plate mail, leggings, bracers, helmets,
and boots. There isn't a lot of traffic into the shop, since its members are
few in number and avoid comming to the guild unless its a matter of great
importance. Theres a keeper behind the desk, he catalogs anything bought, sold,
or brought in. It is a boring job, attending a shop, but someone has to.

On a the Deck of a&+y War Ship~
   The bare feet of the crew make some thuds against the planks of the deck.
A crew of twenty is required to operate this huge ship. The work never stops
on a ship at sea, which makes strong backs. Huge poles rise up toward the
sky, once the masts are up, with the wind willing, this passenger ship could
make great time in the open sea. The hull looks as though it needs a good
scrub down, as if it's been sailing hard the past few weeks. The deck, also,
needs a good cleaning, and many a ship hand are doing just that. The huge sails
that would catch the wind so vigilantly are tied down, so as not to damage the
masts or ship hand alike. A rail four feet high runs the perimeter of the ship,
as a precaution and something to hang onto for those landlubbers who feel the
need to vomit their dinner overboard.&n

&+b   This is the armor shop that the guild members of Lo'Ushuur go to. It sells
&+ba variety of armor and strange items gathered from afar. Vernadad, the house
&+bfounder, selected Burnn to run the shop because of his candor and respect for
&+bthe power of the house. He deals in armor all across the city to get the
&+bgreatest quality items to sell to these members. Burnn grew up in a small
&+btown outside of the great city Tharnadia. He's used to city life and dealing
&+bwith merchants to buy the greatest quality armor. Burnn once served under a
&+bforger inside of Tharnadia as well, which makes him able to repair items.
&+bThere are a great number of armaments inside this room, from far away places.

The &+LSleeping Chamber&n of &+LVernadad&n~
&+L   This is the private chambers of Vernadad Lo'Ushuur, the second most powerful
&+Lman in the city. The sultan is the most powerful, however, Vernadad is not far
&+Lbehind. Vernadad is in control of the shady smuggling that comes and goes from
&+Lthe city, which brings alot of money into the city. The sultan keeps Vernadad
&+Laround simply because of that. Without the money that comes into the city,
&+Lthe sultan himself would have no tax money, therefore no power. Vernadad isn't
&+Lstupid, he has his own safeguards against the sultan and the other houses in
&+Lthe city and only he knows them all. There is a large bed in the far corner
&+Lof the room next to the window white veils hanging down surrounding it,
&+LVernadad's bed no doubt. Pictures framed in gold hang from the walls, only
&+Lthe master know's what they mean and where they came from.

Before a &+yLarge Encampment~
&+y   The desert comes alive with the sound of music and celebration. A large
&+yencampment of desert nomads is to the north. This encampment houses some of
&+ythe most hardened nomads and villains ever to set foot on this continent. It
&+ytakes a different breed of person to live within a desert, and it takes a
&+ygreat deal of strength. There are many in this encampment who would no
&+ydoubtably take a life for no particular reason other than just something to
&+ydo. The desert heat creates a lot of ill sentiment to outsiders and the
&+yordinary visitor is not welcome. There are no fences to this encampment of
&+ynomads, however, a few dogs will alert anyone to outsiders. Smoke rises above
&+ythe camp as they celebrate something. The sultan has deemed this camp refuge
&+yfor the vile, and it is rumored he's place a price on everyone's head.

&+yA Desert Dune Encampment~
   It is here that the many who are running from something come to live within
a community of sorts. There are a great many unwritten codes to follow if you
step foot within this encampment of inhospitable nomads and villains. Years
of crime and hard living is the only way to learn the unwritten code, otherwise
you'll simply be an outsider. Outsiders are not welcome in this encampment,
and unless otherwise marked by someone of influence, they are cut down on
site. The desert encampment is simply an assortment of tents gathered around
a larger center tent. The center tent is the house of the great desert dune
lord Aracthos, who is said to have amassed a great supply of wealth in his
years of crime and extortion. It is said that he grew up a youngling in the
city of Tharnadia, there was inducted into a thievery college. The college,
however, was not optional, because it was run by a band of brute hearts who
kidnapped little boys and girls and forced them to steal. Rumors of Aracthos
are numerous and can be heard at any bar or tavern.

Before a &+yLarge &+YTent&n~
   This desert camp is controlled by Aracthos, the leader of the desert nomads
of this dune. The desert nomads are said to have conducted raids and small
ambushes on unsusupecting travelers, they are the pirates of the desert. It is
said that the sultan looks down upon this encampment as a refuge for those with
evil intent, much like himself. He is weary of anyone with means that lives
within the city limits because it could spell a rivalry or some sort of
conflict with them. The wind blows steadily here and there is a slight high
pitch squeel from the ropes breaking the wind. Sand is picked up by the wind
and carried into the air making goggles or hoods necessary. There isn't much
activity outside the tents, however, inside the large tent there is music and
celebration as always. The smaller tents around the larger one house the many
nomads that have banded together lead by Aracthos. Small arms are leaning
against tents and lay here and there. The smell of food is in the air.

Inside a &+yLarge &+YTent&n~
   This is the largest tent of this nomad camp. It houses a great many parties
and the lord of the nomads, Aracthos. Aracthos is a power man with a great
many talents. It is said that he practiced wizardry and can rival a ranger
with markmanship. His ruthlessness in battle is apalling and it is said that
he even murders women and children. Its all the same in the end to him, as
long as he gets what he wants. The tent smells of freshly cooked meat and
ale. It is littered with scraps and a few empty bottles. The tent is held up
by an assortment of ropes and beems and rises well over twenty feet. It would
take a humongous sand storm the likes no one has ever seen to blow this thing
down. In the center of the room are tables and chairs for guests to sit and
feast. There are private rooms here and there that are sealed off and protected
by master swordsman hired by Aracthos. Outsiders are not welcome.

Near an &+bO&+ga&+bs&+gis~
&+y   This desert city has one great weakness, despite the Sultan's greatest
&+yefforts to strengthen his city, water. Living in a desert habitat makes one
&+ywatch what he wastes. The desert surrounds the city structures in this area,
&+yand this is one of the most heavily populated areas of the city. One reason
&+yfor this being, an oasis lays nearby. This oasis isn't the major source of
&+ywater for the city, however, whomever has enough money can allocate a spot to
&+ysupply himself with water from this oasis. One cannot freely walk up to this
&+yprecious supplier of water undaunted, for there are guards to protect it's
&+yoveruse. The sultan has been known on occasion to post bounties on those who
&+ysteal his precious water, without paying. The stones that make up the wrong
&+yare packed into the desert sand. During the night, travelers need light,
&+ytherefore, the sultan built an array of poles about twenty feet apart, each
&+ywith a lantern on top.

On an&+g Elegant&+W Elven &+GCruiser~
   It's too noisy out here, the elven captains like it nice. It is said that
an elven cruiser could sneak up on any enemy vessel in the dead of night and
take the ship in a matter of minutes. The magical masks that do this have
runes painted on them, allowing them to flap silently. The hull also has runes
painted on them, an elven magic that provides protection and stealth. During
the day these runes provide protection from enemy vessels, the magic provides
camelfauge so that anyone not looking for the ship will not see it. The deck
is large, large with alot of space. The masks are a medium size, not very
heavy. Elven sailors manage the ship for the captain, who can be found by the
helm, he shouts orders regularly.
