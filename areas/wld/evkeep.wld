&+yThe Huge &+gArched &+yGates Leading Into the &+LDreary Tower~
   &+yThe &+LTower &+yseems to be well &+cfortified&+y. It is built from large &+Lgrey rocks
&+ythat have been fastened to each other with some kind of mortar. With walls
&+ytwenty feet thick, &+rgrills &+yat entrance, this &+LTower &+yis the goal of every invader.
&+yThere are small&N windows &+yall over the &+LTower&+y. The gates are tremendous! Made from
&+ya set of rusting steel plates set deep into the &+Lstone&+y. They are covered with
&+ygrotesque faces and other creatures in various poses and acts of violence and
&+ylust. They are &+rburned&+y, &+gscarred&+y, attacked with &+Bmagic&+y, and show signs of great
&+yabuse, but they are still standing. Built to withstand an extended direct
&+yassault, the keep has been stocked with supplies to last two years.

&+Lif is it the wind or did someone make that noise?

&+LThe &+bSouthern &+LCorridor of the Dark Tower~
   &+LThis is a dark corridor decorated with paintings and sculptures. The walls

&+gThe &+CSteel &+gDoor Leading into the &+LPr&+gis&+Lon~
   &+gThe fairly empty building that serves as the &+LPr&+gis&+Lon &+gfor the &+LTower&+g.
&+gThe building is small because the &+LTower &+gOwners do not make a habit of
&+gtaking prisoners, and those that they do capture do not last long. This place
&+ghas enough room to hold several score of people, but it appears that this large
&+groom is not fully complete in construction, and that the inhabitants here have
&+gmade some make-shift arrangements. Sounds are very weird in this place. Many
&+gwritings on the wall are inspirational sayings... trying to remind &+Levil
&+Lfollowers &+gthat they are hurting &+Chumanoid beings&+g. Much thought and planning went
&+ginto the effort as not even the best thief in the world could open the prison
&+gdoor. Some sounds, like shrieks and &+rblood&+g-curdling shouts are amplified.

A &+cDank&N, &+LDark&N, &+gSmelly&N Hole~
   This path is very well worn, it's &+Ldark&N and there is almost a musty odor
to it. It is very sparsely furnished, containing only most basic housekeeping
equipment. The walls are covered with &+Mtwisted faces&N of a countless tortured
&+Wsouls&N crying out in agony. A &+ypiles of horse droppings&N lying on the floor give
off an unbearable stink. The air is dusty, with the stench of &+rburnt &+ccarcasses
of various animals and meager bits of &+gw&+yoo&+gd&N. Several rickety chairs sit in at
the walls, looking as if they might not hold the weight of the next customer
to sit down.

The &+mArmourer's&N Working Room~
   This is a room called 'Blacksmith', where its owner - the &+Wone&N-&+Ceyed&N armorer,
is smithing and fixing the armors and weapons for the &+CSabre&+LTooth Grin Clan's
soldiers. Against the north wall is a big &+Mfu&+rrna&+Mce&N that pushing waves of &+Rheat&N,
its obviously used for the &+cironworking&N. An anvil sits on one side of the room,
and on the other side is a workbench.Thanks to nearly a lifetime of adventuring
the armorer has collected a fine collection protective armor. His smithy is
impressive with all of his greatest works hanging on the walls. Large &+gwo&+yod&+gen
barrels hold dozens of spears and arrows, while unstrung bows hang from hooks
on the wall. Cases and bookshelves hold hundreds of swords and knives. Many of
the weapons appear to be home made... perhaps for the guards. The other items
are very very good. Each weapon looks &+Wpolished&N, &+Ysharpened&N, and &+yoiled&N, but
unfortunately the armorer don't do business with outsiders.
The door to the forge is thick, made from a knotted and twisted &+Lgreyish &+gwood&N.

&+rThe smell of &+Mbrimstone &+rand &+Ysulfur &+rfill the air. The stone walls are blackened

&+LThe Chamber of a Huge &+RSacrificial &+LAltar~
   &+cThis large hall is circular in shape and open on all sides, as the ceiling
&+cis supported by pillars made of the deep &+rred &+cstone. All the items in this room
&+clook ancient yet strangely very powerful and rich.&+WM&+La&+Wrb&+Ll&+We &+ccolumns line the walls
&+cand &+Ccrystal &+cchandeliers hang from the ceiling. In the center of the room is
&+ca massive &+Rfurnace &+cwhich emits great gouts of heat and a strange smell which
&+ccomes from the melting of the &+Wsi&+Llve&+Wry &+cpentagram used by the priests. The walls
&+care coated with &+rblood&+c, bits of &+rbloody &+cflesh lie on the floor,and torn clothing
&+cis scattered about. There is a &+mcauldron &+cin the corner bubbling madly, belching
&+ca foul brew that must have come from hell. A huge sacrificial &+Maltar &+ccovered
&+cin &+rbloodstains &+cstands against the west wall. Engraved on the top of the alter
&+cis a giant spider with a human head. This must be place where the &+CSabre&+LTooth
&+LGrin Clan's &+cmembers conduct their cermonies, glorifying their &+LEvil Gods&+c.

&+LThe Alc&+Chem&+List's Shop~
   &+LThe shop is a small room in a secret section of the fortress. The whole
&+Lroom is coated with &+ydust &+Land&N cobwebs&+L. In the center of the room stands a large
&+Ldesk, and on the wall behind it are numerous shelves crammed with jars,bottles,
&+Lbooks and scrolls of all sorts and sizes. The &+Rwarm &+Wlight &+Lemanating from
&+Lthe small &+yoil &+Llamps on the walls is reflected in the hard, polished surface
&+Lof the big &+gmahogany &+Ldesk. A bookcase rests against the wall. The floor is
&+Lcovered with half-erased &+rpentagrams &+Land even weirder symbols. A blackboard
&+Lin a dark corner has only been partially cleaned, some painful-looking letters
&+Lfaintly visible.A long&N glass tubes &+Land scores of oddly shaped vials and bottles
&+Lare everywhere. It is incredibly messy here, crushed&N glass &+Land other trash
&+Llitter the floor. A fine mess the alc&+Chem&+List made of this room, how he can find
&+Lanything here is a complete mistery, &+Gfood&N bottle &+Lscotch everything lies through
&+Lanother. An old &+gstench &+Lemanates from this room, as &+ydust &+Lseems to continually
&+Lflow from the old arch.

&+LThe &+CPalace &+LEntrance~
   &+LObsidian &+cwalls engraved with ancient runes of power stretch out here.Magical
&+cenergies seem to crackle with power all around and whisper in tongues long
&+cforgotten, almost as if the &+CPalace &+LEntrance &+cif self were alive. Beautiful
&+ctapestries displaying the Acient Masters of Palace are on the walls, and
&+cthe floor is covered with a plush multicolored carpet, which seems to rustle
&+cand move at the touch of boots. &+YGold &+ctiles etched with &+Wplatinum &+ccover
&+cthe walls and the ceiling. The lights from numerous &+Ytorches &+creflect from these
&+cshimmering planes, giving the illusion standing in a gem.

&+yThe Chamber of &+LDarkness~
   &+LThe light doesn't even seem to work here. Even &+Ymagical &+Wlight &+Lsources seem
&+Lonly to illuminate about a foot ahead. The walls are fade into darkness,
&+Lleaving with a very vague idea of the actual size of the room. Swirling
&+Lhere and there is the dark, are patches of pure black which seem to suck in
&+Llight and leave it that much darker here. The air here seems quite stale,
&+Land a sense of extreme dread comes over. The stench of &+yro&+gtt&+yen &+gflesh &+Lseems
&+Lto be wafting in from the corners.

&+LA large wooden staircase leads up into the enormous hall. There is great danger

&+RThe Inter&+Lsection &+Rof Two Hallways~
   &+RThis is an intersection of several hallways. A strange mystical forces are
&+Rpushing and pulling at each other from all around. This large room is cut in
&+Rinto section by small &+rwalls &+Rof fire. The walls to move slowly changing
&+Rthe layout of the room. When examine the room further could notice various
&+Rposts around the room to which people are chained to. The &+rfirewalls &+Rseem
&+Rto move in patterns that leave the poor people directly in the path of the
&+Rincoming &+rfire&+R. The walls seem to creep ever so slowly towards them. The
&+Rpeople blister and scream as the fire gets closer. Thier deaths seem like
&+Rminutes of agony and pain, and even as they burst into flames they
&+Rseem incapable of grasping the marciful attention of death...

&+WThe &+rRed &+WRoom~
   &+rThis is the red room, one of the guest rooms in the &+CPalace&+r. The walls
&+rare wallpapered a deep &+Rwarm red&+r, and &+Ldark &+rmahogany panelling nicely complements
&+rthem. There is a large, warm waterbed and sofa group in dark wood with leather
&+rupholstery, including a coffee table. Everything except the gleaming black
&+rmarble floor seems to be made from searing flames. Somehow, even though
&+rthe room is filled with fire, the flames emanate utter &+Bcold &+rinstead of &+Rheat&+r.
&+rThat might not have been such a good idea to come here...

The &+RB&Na&+Rl&Nl&+Rr&No&+Ro&Nm~
   This is large room in the middle of a vast palisader floor. The walls are
heavy &+Lst&+wo&+Lnes&N blocks that rise tens of feet above head, covered with panels
of strangely knotted of twisted &+gw&+yoo&+gd&N. On the floor are charcoal stencils of
pentagrams and various other ominous sigils. In the center of the room is
a &+Ltable&N made from half of a giant &+rred&Nwood. Deeply polished and beautifully
emblazoned this table seats approximately fifty persons. There is a &+gdesk&N in
the corner of the room which looks very functional. There is one painting on
the wall, can't quite make it out, because it is what these new artist fools
call abstract. The &+ycloth-covered&N chairs standing forlornly in a corner.

   This is an amazing huge, truly a magnificent place! Books and scrolls lie
together on every shelf. A large globe with the map of the &+RDuris-world&N upon it,
stands in the dimly lit north-western corner of the room. Two large and
confortable-looking arm-chairs are made from &+yold leather&N, and yet they seem so
worn that they can be nothing but a perfect place for a long needed rest, are
adorn the center of the library together with a huge &+go&+ya&+gk desk&N. Dim light
radiates from an enormous &+Wcrystal chandelier&N hanging down from the ceiling
approximately ten feet off the floor. To the southeast there is a glass door.

&+WThe &+bBlue &+WRoom~
   &+bThis is the &+Bblue &+broom, one of the guest rooms in the &+CPalace&+b. The walls
&+bare blue, and the rest of the room is decorated in similar &+Lshades&+b, producing
&+ba very nice, cool effect. Small bolts of energy leap from wall to wall
&+bcrackling with power. The floor is a swirl of indeterminable colors and
&+bpatterns ever changing. Bright bursts of color seem to explode into the air
&+band fade again at random times. All this splendor plays about and draws
&+battention to a small altar in the center of the room, it seems to be cut from
&+ba single enormous emerald.

&+LThe S&+wt&+Wo&+Wn&+Le Archway~
   &+LThis is an ancient stone archway. Various faces of demons and other grin
&+Lpictures are painted onto it. The stone gargoyles and demons glare down from
&+Latop the arch. The walls in this room are definitely lined with paintings of
&+LDragons and battles with Dragons. In the later it always appears the Dragons
&+Lare winning. Wonderful paintings decorate the ceiling of this hallway.
&+LTremendous efforts have been gone into making this an example for all visiting
&+Ldignitaries to take back to their homes. The walls emit a faint magical glow
&+Lwhich provides enough light to see by. The wide floor of the hall in an expanse
&+Lof marble. Arrow slots have been cut into the walls and steel grills are ready
&+Lto crash capture anyone in the Archway without permission. It is not really &+rhot
&+Lin here, though, rather a pleasantly warm temperature.

&+rThe &+RRed &+rHall~
   &+rThis beautifully decorated room  contains some of strangest trophies.
&+rBattle trophies occupy the majority of the wall space, however, there are
&+ralso some hunting trophies intermixed with the shields, banners, and weapons
&+rof long vanquished enemies. The walls of this room glow and hum as if it is
&+ralive.The tapestries were woven into beautiful and exciting scenes of
&+rbattles long ago. One on the left shows the historic battle between the Evil
&+rand the Good forces that eventually Evil army won. A huge black cauldron is
&+rin the center of the room, bubbling and gurgling, it pours forth a constant
&+rstream of smokey fog into air. Here and there on stands of different sizes
&+rare crystal balls and oddly shaped mirrors. The generals gather here to
&+rdiscuss training strategies and count their loot. Here are papers which look
&+rlike important secret documents lying around. It seems that the loot comes
&+rfrom raids on the towns in the surrounding areas above ground.
&+rFrom the documents it seems that the pages and trainees are kidnapped from
&+rthe villages!

&+yThe &+YAudi&+Wence &+yRoom~
   &+gThere is a large oaken desk in the center of the room, with many parchments
&+gand scrolls on it. Audience Chamber is very neat and organized, almost to
&+gthe point of obsessive. The most notable thing in the room is a small set of
&+gscales, which floats about eye level. Shelves filled with many books or arcane
&+gknowledge are on every wall. Tall candles illuminate this area a soft light
&+gthat is very soothing and calming. Silver candlesticks are scattered about,
&+gand on the walls, amoungst the shields, banners and other trophies of war.
&+gThe tapestries were woven into beautiful and exciting scenes of battles long
&+gago. One of them is a scene of ghastly horror; An army of undead creatures of
&+gall types are lined up patiently. Their leader is an evil demonoid necromancer.
&+gHis plans to use his army of undead to take over the world seem about ready
&+gto get underway.

&+cThe &+CThrone &+cRoom~
   &+CThis is a large, crudely decorated throne room. A huge throne adorned with
&+Chumanoid skulls sits against the west wall. This golden throne is so huge that
&+Cit takes up almost the entire wall, stretching far above the floor.It's evident
&+Cthat this throne is more of a decoration than anything else. Only the largest
&+Cof kings could sit upon it.The high vaulted ceiling is carved from solid stone.
&+CA huge stone pillars rise up from the floor to meet the ceiling far above.
&+CThe architecture appears to be elven. The Crude torches light the hall, smoke
&+Cclings to the ceiling. The walls have intricate paintings of dragons upon them.
&+CThere are not the good dragons in the paintings though, they are all of famous
&+Cevil dragons like &+LTiamat &+Cthe five headed.

&+YThe &+RAltar &+YChamber~
   &+YThis is a huge chapel designed around a beautifully crafted golden altar.
&+YThe eyes have trouble adjusting to the dim lighting. All around are columnar
&+Ystatues of demons turned towards the altar standing at the top of a series
&+Yof steps. The altar is coverted in blood and radiates unspeakable power that
&+Yis absorbed by the horrible presence which stands in the middle. The alter
&+Yis a huge sacrificial altar covered in bloodstains. The stains of blood run
&+Ydown off the altar towards the feet, oozing quietly.A small globe of magical
&+Yenergy floats overhead, providing light. Many icons to lesser deities line
&+Ythe room, but it is obvious by one glance at the symbols on the altar, that
&+Ythis room was designed for the glory of Duris Gods.

&+bThe Underwater Cave~
   &+bThis Cave is enormous. It mostly flooded with water. The air is very humid
&+band misty, smells of brimstone and makes lungs burn with every breath.
&+bLarge piles of &+Wbones &+blay all over. The stench is overwhelming. Looking around,
&+bseems like some bizarre and horrible creature uses this cave as a home.
&+bSeveral half-eaten &+rcorpses &+bare rotting away slowly in the gloomy &+Ldarkness&+b.
&+bIn the back of the cave, you see a large pile of rotting cloth, fur, and
&+bplant matter. The walls are covered with scratches and claws marks.
&+bThe corners are pitch black still, there is the faint &+Cgleam &+wof &+Wlight
&+bcoming from many &+Ycrystal &+bformations. Huge stalamites and other formations
&+bcombine in a successful efford to create a wonderland.
&+bThe soft sound of dropping water sends echoes throughout the cavern.
