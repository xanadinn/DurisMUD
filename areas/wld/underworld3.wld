&+mA Vertical Shaft&n~
   The underworld has been opened up here and descends
down a smooth shaft.  This shaft looks like it has been
created by some type of worm, perhaps a purple worm, due
to the residue left on the walls.  The area has a foul
smell in the air, as if something were alive down here.

  The floor of this cavern is entirely submerged in thick black mud, and
probably is quite deep.  The sludge is so viscous that walking upon it is
actually possible without sinking in.  The area itself is about a three hundred

&+mA Mushroom Filled Tunnel&n~
  This tunnel stretches out very wide and is lined
with various mushroom growths of different sizes.  If
this were the surface, it may look like a forest.

&+BOn a Large Underground Lake&n~
   This underground lake spans as far as
the eye can see in this large underground
cavern.  Sightless fish fill the lake,
whose water is mucky and has an odd smell
to it.  The sound of splashing can be heard

&+mA Mushroom Filled Tunnel&n~
  This tunnel stretches out very wide and is lined
with various mushroom growths of different sizes.  If
this were the surface, it may look like a forest.
However, in the underworld, it is a deathly cavern
glowing ever so faintly from the fungi.
