&+w     It is warm in this room with &+Rmus&+Wh&+Rro&+Wo&+Rms&+w growing everywhere out of a &+Gmossy&n
&+wfloor.  Sparkles of &+Bb&+Cl&+Bue &+Cl&+Big&+Ch&+Bt&+w fly around the room as the strong air currents&n
&+wpush them in random directions.  The &+Rmus&+Wh&+Rro&+Wo&+Rms&+w have thick gray stems and wide&n
&+wbright &+Rred&+w caps with &+Wwhite&+w spots.  Upon the stems are windows and doors which&n
&+wthe small people use, going in and out of the &+Rmus&+Wh&+Rro&+Wo&+Rms&+w at a rapid pace.  All&n
&+wover the room are smaller &+Rmus&+Wh&+Rro&+Wo&+Rms&+w which are growing larger. Once they reach&n
&+wfull growth, doors and windows appear on the stems and more small people come&n
&+wout to join the throng already in the room.&n

&+wout of the &+Rmus&+Wh&+Rro&+Wo&+Rms&+w, and even to live in them since there is no exit for them&n
