&+yA &+WCloudy&+y Pass Between the Mountains&n~
&+y   The rocky climb up the mountains suddenly levels off here before
&+ya pair of enormous &+Wwhite crystal &+ygates. Obviously this is an extremely
&+ysecluded land, being so far up in the mountain peaks, and can only be
&+ythe fabled city of &+WUltarium&+y.&n

&+WThe Lunar Gates&n~
&+W   These massive crystalline gates protect the city of Ultarium from
&+Woutsiders as well as acting as a windblocker. The city itself has
&+Wbeen built so high up into the mountain peaks themselves, that the
&+Wchill of the winds can be incredibly dangerous to those unwary. However
&+Where in Ultarium, everyone is aware of their surroundings, and much of
&+Wthe city has been built to harness the power of the wind, the sky,
&+Wthe mountains, and of course, the cosmos. Stern gate guards watch over
&+Wtheir area intently, checking almost everyone that comes and goes for
&+Wthe proper identification.&n

&+YStarwatcher &+WPlaza&n~
&+W  This is one of the most popular plaza's in the city, situated directly
&+Wnorth of the Lunar Gates. A huge display of the planets and stars has been
&+Wset up here, a miracle of modern workmanship, it even moves in a scaled-
&+Wdown but accurate formation.  There are a few benches and planted flower
&+Wbeds to keep the plaza beautiful. Scholar's Tower lies just to the west,
&+Wwhile &+YSaturn's Way&+W leads north, and Scholar's Road east.

&+yA &+WWatchtower&+y on the Cliffside&n~
&+W   This is but a simple guard station, built on the mountain side that
&+Woverlooks the eastern coastal region. Though no one talks about it it
&+Walso serves as a lookout over the &+YAppollyon Fortress&+W, as the m&+woon&+Wst&+wo&+Wne
&+Wgroup is quietly paranoid over the actions of the high council. Like the
&+Wother guardhouses and watchtowers in the city, this is built from rock
&+Wfrom the lunar satellite, and rises a couple stories into the sky.

&+cfrom structure to structure, this one is used to help pump fresh water
&+cfrom an underground spring through a series of pipes to the fountains
&+cbuilt along the &+WPath of the &+COracle&+c. There is a small ladder that leads

&+yLanding by the Shipyards&n~
&+y   At the landing of this cliff face is one of the most important areas
&+yin the entire city. The shipyards themselves lay to the north, where
&+ythe hulking framework of the massive vessels are worked on. To the west
&+yis the constructi&+won lane, where the lesser pieces are assembled and the
&+wengineers help with the design. A door to the east leads into a large
&+wtwo-story building where the airship crews sleep while on leave.&n

&+YThe Eastern Balcony&n~
&+Y   The balcony over hangs from the eastern side of the fortress quite
&+Ya large distance.  From here one can clearly see the ocean spread out
&+Ythousands of feet below through the wisp of slow moving clouds. The air
&+Yis biting and the view is intense, the combination causing a unconcious
&+Ygasp from all who stand here. There is a magical platform that takes
&+Yup most of the floor of the balcony here, that the council uses in case
&+Yemergency.&n

&+LA Twisting Mountain Cave&n~

&+wto the hustle and &+Lbustle of the city just a few dozen feet of rock above.
&+wIt appears near&+Lly unused to the untrained eye, but if one was too look
&+whard enough &+Ltracks of intelligent life can be seen, almost as if someone
&+wwas stron&+Lgly trying hard not to be found.  The typical mountain cave
&+wcritte&+Lr scampers and clicks away in the darkness.&n

&+ydo their best to co-exist with the natural enviroment, so it is strange
&+yto see this cavern dug out. The small mountain path to the watchtower is

&+y   This appears to be the begining of a fairly well-used mountain
&+ytrail, that leads up through the mountain range towards the northeast.
&+yThe air is still warm from the nearby lava flows, but it obviously
&+ychills as trail leads upwards, as the peaks in the distance can be
&+yseen covered in snow.&n

&+yA Well-Used Mountain Trail&n~
&+y   This trail winds up through the mountain range, and appears to be
&+ywell looked after. The path is clear of loose rocks and the weeds
&+yhave all been pulled. Glancing up ahead it is near impossible to see
&+ywhere the trail leads to, but obviously high up into the mountains.
