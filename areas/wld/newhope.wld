&+rA Sandy Walkway by the Gates&n~
&+r   To the north, the side of a building blocks the way, but the sandy walkway&n
&+rgoes around it, both to the east and the west.  To the south, tall gates made&n
&+rfrom a &+Lblack stone&+r offer the only way through the thick walls surrounding and&n
&+rprotecting this place.  A wide variety of races of people are on the walkway,&n
&+rbut they all seem to tolerate those that live here.&n

&+yalong the &+Wskull-&+wchains&+y that hold the &+wc&+Lh&+wan&+Ld&+we&+Ll&+wier&+y up.  A closer inspection of&n
&+ythe &+wchains&+y show that they are made from &+Wskulls&+y threaded together, using the&n

&+yIn a &+cCage&+y Atop &+bThe &+LLa&+bi&+Lr &+bof the &+LL&+be&+Lche&+br&+Lous L&+be&+we&+bc&+Lh&n~
&+y   The east, west, and south walls of this part of the room are actually bars&n
&+ymade from &+cstrong steel.  Chains&+y and &+cmanacles&+y hang from the bars, and &+Wbones&+y on&n
&+ythe floor attest to the fact that the innkeeper does not hesitate to use this&n
&+yas promised on the sign at the entrance to the inn.  A few vine tendrils hamg&n
&+ydown from the nearby huge trees, and those who stand long enough can see them&n
&+yslowly move along the bones, searching for tender flesh to feed on.  Even the&n
&+yundead would be harmed in this cage, as they would be held in the bright, hot&n
&+Ysu&+Wn&+Ylig&+Wh&+Yt&+y until they, too, would expire.&n

&+rPeople of many races can be seen, but even those whose peoples have been at&n
&+rwar for centuries do not fight here as their fear of the &+bmaster&+r of the &+Lkeep&n
&+r is stronger than their hatred.&n

&+r   On one side of the room is a small, neat cot with a chest at its foot.  On&n
&+rthe other side of the room is a messy pile of bedding shoved into a corner in&n
&+rwhich small creatures play.  Clothing is also mixed into this pile of bedding&n
&+rwhich probably has not been cleaned in a very long time, if ever. It is clear&n
&+rthat &+bGruug&+r and the &+yhalfling&+r share these quarters, but it seems that they have&n
&+rcome to an agreement that suits both of them.&n

&+CIn a Carving Room&n~
&+r   The door to the west leads back out to the warm sands of the walkway, but&n
&+rin here, where artists work in their mediums, the air is a bit chilly. &+wS&+Wt&+wone&n
&+wc&+Wh&+wi&+Wp&+ws&+r from the &+yhalfling&+r in the southeast corner carving on gemstones and the&n
&+bogre&+r in the southwest corner carving much stronger stone are scattered about&n
&+rthe room.  The assistants in here are too busy watching the masters at work,&n
&+rright now, to clean up, but they will be busy later removing the debris.&n

&+rOn a Sandy Walkway&n~
&+r   The walkway continues to wind between shops and the strange &+wwi&+Lth&+were&+Ld t&+wrees&n
&+rthat grow throughout the town.  These trees are needed for the town to exist,&n
&+ras they provide a sheltering canopy which completely blocks the &+Ysun&+Wl&+Yi&+Wght&+r from&n
&+rreaching the town.  Though the &+Wl&+Yi&+Wght&+r from the &+Ysun&+r cannot reach down into this&n
&+rtown, the heat is still intense along the sandy walkway.&n

&+rgo shopping or just to stroll around before going back to their &+Wh&+wu&+Wts.&n

&+r   Curtains section off various parts of the room, but a huge bath dominates&n
&+rthis part of the room.  Steam rises from the bath and petals floating on the&n
&+rwater give off a pleasant aroma.  Cushions strewn about the bath provide any&n
&+rwho wish to visit but not bathe a comfortable place to sit and visit.  Gauzy&n
&+rcurtains sway when anyone passes them, parting for a brief moment due to the&n
&+rgentle breeze to reveal a great variety of beds and bedding that is provided&n
&+rfor the concubines of the &+blord&+r of the &+Lkeep.&n

&+rOn a Sandy Walkway&n~
&+r   To the north, the sandy walkway continues toward the &+LDark Keep&+r while to the&n
&+rwest it leads away from the area. The sand that covers the ground is the color&n
&+rof dried blood.  Tracks from small &+canimals&+r cross the walkway, going from bases&n
&+rof &+wplants&+r that seem withered and dead on one side of the walkway to the other.&n
&+rThese &+wplants&+r have been cultivated to create a high canopy which blocks out all&n
&+rof the accursed &+Ysu&+Wn&+Yshi&+Wn&+Ye&+r from this place.&n

&+wTall plants &+rthat seem to be withered and dead have been used to create a high&n

&+rNear the Entrance to the Vault&n~
&+r   The first thing that is noticed about this room is a vile stench that fills&n
&+rthe air.  Its main ingredient seems to be ammonia, but there is no guano about&n
&+rto explain why the smell is here.  Bones of all sizes are strewn about, though&n
&+rthere are a few high piles of them.  Most of the bones are cracked in at least&n
&+rone place, and none of them have even a hint of flesh left upon them.  Any who&n
&+rare even a tiny bit intelligent can sense that something horrendous waits past&n
&+rthis room to the north.&n

&+rIn a Narrow Tunnel&n~
&+r   This very narrow tunnel grows taller, even as it grow narrower.  Though the&n
&+rceiling remains the same height, the floor slopes downward, gradually becoming&n
&+rcompletely submerged.  The water that covers the floor is cold, and has a very&n
&+rstrong mineral taste to it.  To the south, it rises back up onto dry land, but&n
&+rthe only exit to the north is below the water's surface.&n

&+mThe Lair of the T&+ren&+mt&+rac&+ml&+rer, &+mProtector of the Vault&n~
&+r   A &+mt&+ren&+mt&+rac&+ml&+rer lives in this room, and it does not like it when anyone other&n
&+rthan &+bHammerhead&+r comes in here with it.  It will rush forward, attacking that&n
&+rwhich it sees as a foe, which is anything that moves or breathes.  This room&n
&+ris huge, as the &+mt&+ren&+mt&+rac&+ml&+rer itself is huge.  It is the perfect guard, as it is&n
&+rnot alive, so it does not need to eat or sleep.  The door to the vault is on&n
&+rthe north side of the room, but to get to it, the &+mt&+ren&+mt&+rac&+ml&+rer must be killed.&n

&+yOn a Long Staircase&n~
&+y   While it is quiet toward the top of the stairway, there are shuffling and&n
&+yslurping noises below.  From the smell alcohol has been spilled below, along&n
&+ywith &+rblood.&+y  The stairway is very sturdy, carved from the bedrock upon which&n
&+ythe inn sits, and seems to extend down into the bowels of the earth.&n

&+ra place of unusual quiet where it seems that any sounds entering the area are&n
&+rmuffled and distant.  Metal rungs on the east wall lead back up into the mage&n

&+yIn a Quiet Room&n~
&+y   A large table sitting in the middle of the room has cards scattered across&n
&+ythe top of it from an ongoing game of cards. Several sets of bunk beds placed&n
&+yalong the north and south walls are mostly empty, but some have snoring forms&n
&+yon them as apprentices take a break.  Other apprentices stand near the table,&n
&+ycontinuing a long-running card game.  To the west two people sit quietly, one&n
&+yof which is strumming an instrument and humming a quiet tune.  The other sits&n
&+yexamining somethin in his lap.  On the east wall in here, rungs lead back up.&n

&+gIn an Underground Forest&n~
&+r   The walls have been painted to look as though this were in a &+gd&+Gee&+gp f&+Gores&+gt&+r on&n
&+rtop of the ground, rather than an underground room.  The painting is realistic&n
&+rand it almost seems like a deer, or a rabbit will burst out of the underbrush,&n
&+rrunning through the room.  Two people sit in here, quietly improving their own&n
&+rskills while waiting for students to seek them out.  One is a young &+mdrow&+r woman&n
&+rnamed Concertina, who is strumming a &+ymandolin,&+r composing a new spellsong while&n
&+rshe waits.  The other is a &+Chuman&+r who goes by the name of Tracker who has a few&n
&+rarrows in his lap, checking them for weak spots.&n

&+m   Tables are scattered about the room, containing bodies, body parts, jars of&n
&+mmaterial components, books, scrolls, and all the other things one would expect&n
&+mto find in the laboratory of a necromancer.  A &+Chuman&+m woman is busy at a table,&n
&+msewing a corpse back together, while a &+Rvam&+rpi&+Rre&+m watches her, a look of interest&n
&+mon his face.  A few unattached &+whands&+m move about the room, fetching things that&n
&+mthe necromancer tells them she needs.&n

&+mInside the Vault&n~
&+r   For having such a fierce guard, this is a very small space, with very few&n
&+rthings in here.  And what is here looks like things that should have been in&n
&+rthe trash, not in a vault.  Dust covers the rocks that litter the floor, and&n
&+rhave crushed some of the things that were in here, probably destroying those&n
&+rthings that were actually worth keeping.&n
