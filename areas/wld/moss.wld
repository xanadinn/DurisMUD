&+gRoad to a Small Village&N~
&+y   The Northern Road lies directly to the north here, and this path swerves
&+yaway from it into the &+gwoods&+y. The line of trees is just thick enough to allow
&+yone to see that a small village lies behind it, the closest houses visible
&+ythrough the twigs and branches. Tharnadia is not too far south, and this may
&+ybe one of the small farms that lies nearby where the farmers make use of the
&+yopen lands to grow &+gcrops&+y. However, this is usually the case to the east of
&+ythe city, and it is perhaps unlikely that a farmer toils the land in the woods
&+yto the north of the city of splendor. Possibly it is just a small community
&+ythat happens to be relatively close to &+gKhomani-Khan&+y. One can head back north to
&+ythe Northern Road, or continue south to see more of the village.&N

&+gEntrance to a Small Village&N~
&+y   Once past the line of trees between the town and the Northern Road, one can
&+ysee clearly that this is a small community. Several one-storey buildings line
&+ya rectangular square, which runs a few hundred meters south from here. Behind
&+yand alongside many of these buildings small &+gplots of land &+yare host to crops,
&+yevidence of a farming community. Perhaps there are also larger fields, but if
&+ythere are they are not visible from this point. Several townsfolk can be seen
&+ygoing about their work, either coming from or going to a plot of land. There
&+yis no evidence of any tree stumps, and the area must have been cleared a long
&+ytime ago. The ground is mostly dirt with sections of grass and other shrubs
&+yin those places where traffic is less intensive. The Northern Road lies north.&N

&+yJust South of the Village Gates&N~
&+y   At this point one has entered the village, a symbolic wall of stones forming
&+ythe transition from the line of &+gtrees &+ynorth to the village here. It is more
&+yornamental than functional for no aggressor would ever be stopped by it, but
&+yit does not pretend to be anything else than a line marking the entrance to
&+ythe town itself. Both east and west of here a building stands, small and not
&+yhigher than one storey. Neither looks to be used for permanent occupation,
&+yinstead resembling stalls that might be used for the selling of farm produce
&+yduring the day. The town square starts to the south, where the road widens.
&+ySeveral villagers can be seen, with chickens and pigs running around freely,
&+ysticking their noses in everything that interests them.&N

&+GA Small Vegetable Stand&N~
&+G   In this building east of the village's entrance, which is actually nothing
&+Gmore than a simple shack, a &+ywooden plank &+Gcovers the entire front section of the
&+Gstructure. On this, a collection of vegetables and other produce the townsfolk
&+Gmake can be seen. The owner must have chosen to operate this stand here due to
&+Gits proximity to the Northern Road and the Road Crossing, where many travelers
&+Gpass. Whether or not he does good business, is perhaps best asked to the owner.
&+GA burlap length of cloth lies on the floor behind the board, and this must be
&+Gused to cover the produce at nighttime or when it rains heavily, for the roof
&+Glooks like it may not stop all &+bwater &+Gfrom coming through. The stand continues
&+Gfor maybe two meters, and sacks, chests and barrels stand about in the rear.&N

&+CSwideth's General Store&N~
&+L   Although it did not quite look like a permanent building from outside, this
&+Lis indeed a store that is inhabited as well. A door leads to the back where
&+Lthe owner has his kitchen and bedroom, and the front section of the structure
&+Lwas once a living room but has now been turned into a store. The door between
&+Lthe front and back rooms has been removed, allowing customers a look into the
&+Lowner's private quarters, but surely he does not mind or it would be closed.
&+LA &+ywooden &+Lcounter stands here, with stalls and shelves all around. Most of the
&+Lproducts are an odd find in a small farming community and it is obvious that
&+Lthey are targeted at travelers and adventurers passing through here before
&+Lheading off to their destination. A bell stands on the counter and a sign
&+Lhangs below it: &+w'Please ring bell if nobody is available to help'.&N

&+gUnder a Large Oak Tree&N~
&+g   This is the northwestern section of the village square. Buildings line every
&+gside of it, but there is a lot of space between them which is used mostly for
&+Gcrops &+gand &+ypiles of wood&+g. A large oak tree stands directly west of here, its
&+gbranches hanging over this section of the open space. A bench stands below it
&+gand some of the older townsfolk might be seen sitting here on days when the
&+gweather is good. The tree's bark is riddled with scars, nails and pieces of
&+ywood &+gwhere children probably tried to build a ladder, but this only adds to
&+gits venerability. South of here the square opens up to the east as well, and
&+gsome farmland can now be seen behind the buildings there. This tree must be
&+gseveral hundred years old, having witnessed the clearing of the area around
&+git and then the construction of the village.&N

&+yNorth of the Village's Center&N~
&+y   This is the northern end of the town square. The back of a small structure
&+yblocks passage to the north, and behind it the &+gfoliage &+yand &+gtrees &+ystart again.
&+yFrom this point one can look all across the square, which is perhaps three
&+yhundred meters in length. The size of the town square is somewhat surprising
&+yas there are only a handful of buildings lining it, but perhaps it was once
&+ya plot of land that has since turned into this open space. A path leads to
&+ythe east where it continues into the woods that stand at the square's edge.
&+yA group of birds has chosen the trees to the north as their roost for the
&+ynight, and their sounds and flapping of the wings make more noise than the
&+yvillagers to the south. Several &+Mpiglets &+yrun around the square to the south.&N

&+yCenter of the Village Square&N~
&+y   The center of the village square, from here one can see the structures on
&+yall sides of the clearing. The dirt under foot here has been compacted from
&+yall the townsfolk walking over it, and the imprints of hooves can be seen as
&+ywell - undoubtedly some cattle the farmers keep. South of here, a collection
&+yof small stands is visible, but they are not manned at this moment, perhaps
&+ybeing used for a market once a week or something similar. There is no &+bwell&N
&+yor &+bfountain &+yhere, which may appear strange, but the square was obviously not
&+ybuilt around anything in particular. A road between the buildings to the west
&+yleads to some other structures, which are surrounded by farmland. Chickens
&+ywaggle about here, pecking at the dirt in their search for small insects.&N

&+ySome Unmanned Stalls in the Village Square&N~
&+y   Just south of the village square is this collection of stalls. Simple wooden
&+yconstructions, they are nothing more than tables and counters which are most
&+ylikely the setting for a market once a week. Currently they are not used, but
&+ysome remnants of the goods sold last time can be seen at the foot of these
&+ystalls: &+mbeets&+y, yroots and other simple &+gvegetables&+y. The stalls show signs of
&+yheavy use, being worn and torn in places, and many scratches and other scars
&+yare visible in the wood. South of here is the end of the square, and to the
&+yeast and west buildings line its length. A group of &+Mpigs &+yruns around these
&+ystalls, sticking their noses in crates and between boards, looking for those
&+ybits and pieces of vegetables and other produce left behind here.&N

&+ySouth End of the Village Square&N~
&+y   The village square ends here, the &+wdirt &+ybeing replaced with a few feet of
&+ggrass &+ywhich is in turn swallowed by small &+gfoliage &+yand &+Ltrees&+y. The treeline
&+yruns east-west here, a small road forming its east end and a fence blocking
&+yit in the west. One can continue south however, for a small &+Wcobblestone &+ypath
&+yheads into the woods. Just north of here a collection of wooden stalls stands
&+ydeserted in the square's southern center. Some of the vegetables sold in the
&+ystalls have been tossed into the shrubs here, probably leftovers or ones that
&+ywere too old to still use. In places, this has even resulted in vegetable
&+yplants sprouting between the other plants.&N

&+yWest Side of the Village Square&N~
&+y   A building that looks like a &+Yfarmhouse &+yrises to the west, many instruments
&+ythat belong on a farm visible either leaning against the wall or lying in
&+yfront of it. This actually seems to be the rear section of the farmhouse,
&+ywhich may be considered a little strange since this square is where one
&+ywould expect all the houses to have their front entrance. Looking further
&+yto the southwest one can see a large field of beets, which probably belongs
&+yto this farmer, and the front of his house must be located on that side as
&+ywell. To the north one can see other structures &+ylining the village square.&N

&+yA Trampled Section of the Village Square&N~
&+y   The earth here has many marks of hooves on it, signs that domestic animals
&+ysuch as cows and horses passed through recently. The vegetation to the south,
&+ywhere the &+Lwoods &+ystart, has been chewed on and several shrubs are completely
&+ybare on the sides where they face the square. Perhaps some &+gfarmland &+ylies to
&+ythe southeast and the farmer moved his livestock to or from it, passing here.
&+yThere is a building directly to the east, and it looks like a barn. Its walls
&+yhave been put together hastily or carelessly, for in many places there are
&+yseveral inches between boards. The air smells faintly of horses.&N

&+WA Cobblestone Path Between &+gTrees&N~
&+g   The village square is to the north of here, and a small path continues south
&+ginto the trees. On either side of the path the plantlife is prolific, and both
&+gsmall shrubs and &+Llarge trees &+gblock all sight further than perhaps ten meters.
&+gThe path has been covered with &+Wcobblestones&+g, most of them a faded &+wgrey &+gcolour,
&+gand it runs further south into the woods. Perhaps one of the townsfolk chose
&+gto live further into the forest, some distance away from the rest of the town,
&+gor it leads to something the villagers regularly use such as beehives or water.
&+gThe village square is north of here, and one can also head into the woods. The
&+gpath to the south looks well tended, and no grass or shrubs grow between the
&+gstones covering its first immediate length. It must be used regularly.&N

&+yIn Front of a Store With a &+cHeater Sign&N~
&+y   Located on the west side of the village square, this building looks a little
&+ymore formidable than the others. Its wooden beams are thicker, and the wood
&+ylooks &+Ldarker&+y, as if it is a different kind. Several heaps of iron lie outside
&+ythe structure, raising suspicion that the store works with metal. The heater
&+yshield hanging outside confirms this, a symbol known throughout the realms as
&+yheralding an &+Carmor &+ystore. This small village looks like and unlikely setting
&+yfor such a store, but the proximity of &+WTharnadia &+yprobably means that a lot of
&+yits business is done with that city. &N

&+yEastern Side of the Village Square&N~
&+y   The square meets several &+wbuildings &+yto the east, all single storey and not
&+ylooking much different from one another. Between them the ground has grass
&+ygrowing on it, but this quickly recedes as it reaches the square. The ground
&+yhere is dry, plain earth that has at best small &+gclumps of green &+ygrowing on
&+yit. The buildings may be stores or homes, some perhaps both, but they do not
&+yseem to be farms. Looking behind them one can see small patches of vegetables,
&+ybut nothing that would be for more than personal use. The square continues to
&+ythe west, where buildings can be seen on its other side. The distance it spans
&+yis considerable, perhaps the square was once &+Yfarmland&+y, or there is another
&+ypurpose to this. One can also travel north and south, along its east side.&N

&+YThe Farm's Kitchen and Storage Quarters&N~
&+Y   The section of the farm facing the village square consists of a kitchen
&+Yand many supply closets, including a large one accessed by a regular door. A
&+Ysolidly constructed &+ywooden board &+Yserves as cutting area, and a &+N&+ctub &+Ystands on
&+Ya wooden block next to this. Below the board are several bushels and sacks,
&+Yand a window faces south where one can see the trees of the forest on the
&+Yother side of a path leading to the &+yfarmland &+Ysouthwest. The northern side of
&+Ythe building has a line of &+Wcupboards &+Yattached to the wall, and an internal
&+Ywall with two doors in it is to the west. One of them has a small opening in
&+Yit and one can see that it serves as a closet. The other probably leads to
&+Ythe farm's living room and bedsteads, while the village is to the east.&N

&+cA Well-Stocked Armory&N~
&+y   Once inside the building, its purpose is confirmed. A heavy wooden counter
&+yis located just behind the door, with several pieces of &+Warmor &+yon it. Customers
&+yare however free to walk about the rest of the shop to gauge and try on armor,
&+yand a &+Lchain &+ythat blocks the passage between the counter and the wall during
&+yclosing times is currently hanging idle from the wall. What is remarkable is
&+ythe fact that a section of the northern wall is missing, and a &+wst&+Lon&+we basin
&+yresembling a drinking trough is half inside this room, half outside through
&+ythe hole. Perhaps this makes for easier filling. In the center of the room
&+yis the forge, some &+Lblack coal &+yindicating it is not currently being used. A
&+ypair of bellows has been affixed to a wooden block nearby, so that it can be
&+yoperated with only one hand. A hatch in the roof is the only means for the
&+yheat of the forge to dissipate, and it must be uncomfortable and maybe even
&+ydangerous to work with fire in this wooden building.&N

&+g   The shrubs and trees around have become more plentiful, and most of the
&+gtown has been built in the thicker forest which grows north of &+YTharnadia&+g. A
&+gsection of these woods is to the northeast, where pines and other types of
&+gtree form &+La darker patch &+gthat makes it impossible to see what lies beyond.
&+gTo the east however, the path is &+wclear &+gand one can see the small figures of
&+ghouses more clearly. At this point the road splits, a wider section going
&+gnorth toward the farmland and the narrower part towards the village. West

&+yactually continues, but the wooden gate is closed at the moment and one would
&+yhave to open it to go further. The path gradually slopes down and by the looks
&+yof the section ahead, it travels back up. A &+Bpatch of water &+ysits in the middle
&+yof the road, and the signs of a &+wdried up &+bstream &+ycan be seen crossing through
&+ythe road from north to south. Perhaps the result of heavy rains, or irrigation
&+yon the &+Yfarm &+yto the north. Several thorny &+gshrubs &+yprevent passage in that way,
&+ybut one can clearly see the farmlands behind these.&N

&+YIt heads to the north where a building can be seen at the far side of the
&+Yfarmland, identified in every way as a farmhouse. Chickens run around there,
&+Ybuckets and other utensils lie about, and tools and building materials are
&+Yleaning against the walls. To one's right hand is a patch of trees, which
&+Yalso covers the area behind the farm. This area looks to be a circular plot

&+gof anyone on the &+yTern Road &+gby a hedge some seven feet high. It looks like it
&+gwould fit nicely in a gnomish town, with all the detail and artwork present
&+gin the woodwork. This is something one would not at all expect to find in

&+gthe south of it. A cottage is directly to the south, obscured from the sight
&+gof anyone on the &+yTern Road &+gby a hedge some seven feet high. It looks like it
&+gwould fit nicely in a gnomish town, with all the detail and artwork present
&+gin the woodwork. This is something one would not at all expect to find in
&+gsuch proximity to Tharnadia. One can head further east to the town, or back.&N

&+LA Quaint Country Home&N~
&+y   The inside of this home looks as much like a gnomish house as the outside
&+ydid. Great attention as been payed to detail and everything is arranged so
&+yas to make it look homely. A large couch stands against the southern wall
&+yand fluffy chairs form a half circle on the opposite side. The table between
&+ythem is long and low, and it has been polished to a shine. The window to the
&+ywest looks directly out on the hedge, and because of its height there is not
&+ymuch to see. To the south however, a window looks out over a carefully worked
&+ygarden with both vegetables and flowers. East of here a doorway heads further.&N

&+yOutside a Farmhouse&N~
&+Y   The path along the crops ends here before the farmhouse. It is surrounded
&+Yby thick and ancient trees on both the east and north side, while a stack of
&+Ywood and hay is to the west of it. A small outhouse stands between the trees
&+Yto the right, the path to it obviously used regularly as the grass has faded
&+Yover time. Chickens run about the land here, pecking at insects and objects
&+Yon the ground, but no roost can be seen for them - perhaps it is located at
&+Ythe other end of the farmhouse. Tools and utensils as well as wooden blocks
&+Yand supplies lean against the farmhouse's wall, and a wide door allows one
&+Yto enter the building. West of here are the actual farms, and a path is south.&N

&+G   The plot of land here has been used to grow beanstalks, three pieces of
&+Gwood or twigs tied together at the end in a way so that the plants can grow
&+Gup along their lengths. These six foot triangular skeletons are set in the
&+Gearth two feet apart, and several plants grow up along the same leg. The
&+Gleaves are a deep green, and in several places the beans can be seen amongst
&+Gthem. They show no sign of being eaten by birds or insects, perhaps they are
&+Gnot fully grown yet or the farmer chose a vegetable they have less interest
&+Gin than for example raspberries or fruit. The land continues to the west, a

&+YInside a Farmhouse&N~
&+y   This is the first room of the farmhouse, and it seems to serve as both
&+yliving room and kitchen. Chairs and a table stand in front of a window to
&+ythe south, overlooking the crops to the south. There is very little here
&+ythat looks to be comfortable, for example there is no cloth on the chairs
&+yand little if any decorations and trinkets on the walls. Life may be hard
&+yhere, or perhaps the farmer's family prefers living a sober lifestyle for
&+ythe fields to the south certainly look like they can provide them with a
&+ydecent income. A door leads to the west where the sleeping rooms probably
&+yreside, and a wooden block with a hole in it serves as cutting board for
&+ythe kitchen to the north. Small tubs and containers stand along its length.&N

&+WSleeping Rooms Separated by a &+yScreen&N~
&+y   The west side of the farmhouse is divided into two chambers. It is one
&+yroom actually, but a thin wooden screen has been placed in the room's center
&+yand effectively splits it in two. The left room seems to be for the farmer
&+yand his wife, while the right one has three smaller beds which hints at it
&+ybeing for their children. There is not much room and in due time the farmer
&+ymay choose to build another section to the house, for looking through the
&+ywindows to the back one can see plenty of space for this. The parents'
&+ysection has a drawer, a tub and some nightstands while the children have
&+yonly a single desk, which probably holds their clothes. Some simple wooden
&+ytoys and dolls lie about on the floor and it despite the lack of other
&+yfurniture and goods, it certainly looks like a children's room.&N

&+yPath Around the Farmhouse to the Fields&N~
&+Y   This path runs in front of the farmhouse and heads in a southwest direction
&+Yto where the field of beets is located. It allows one to enter the fields
&+Ywithout having to go through the farmhouse, and may also be used to reach
&+Yanything that lies beyond these fields. This cannot be seen from here though,
&+Yand one would have to travel further to see what lies behind the patch of
&+Yvegetables. To the north is the farmhouse, looking somewhat dilapidated, and
&+Ysouth and east of here stand the trees that also mark the end of the village
&+Ysquare. They are thick and old, a forest that has grown here for ages.&N

&+Ythe plot of land to the southwest, is directly north. It looks like a solidly
&+Yconstructed house, and like the other buildings it only has one storey. A
&+Ythick wooden chopping block stands here, and the trees to the south are
&+Yheralded by several stumps that look like they were recently cut down. The
&+Ycorresponding stack of wood has been piled in front of the trees, which may
&+Ymean that there are no direct plans to cut those down as well. The leaves,
&+Ytwigs and branches that are of no use are piled in front, near the exit to
&+Ythe village square to the northeast. The farmland lies to the southwest.&N

&+gEntrance to a &+mBeet Field&N~
&+m   Several feet to the southwest is where the farmland starts. Many rows of
&+mbeets can be seen running perpendicular to one another, spaced apart perhaps
&+mtwo feet. They have been planted in rows running east-west along the whole
&+mlength of the plot of land. At the far end of the land, maybe three hundred
&+mmeters away, a fenced-in section is home to a small herd of cows. To the
&+mnorth is the farmhouse, a door on the edge of the building leading inside.
&+mSome small barrels stand under the window and they have been filled with
&+mearth, serving as large pots for a collection of various plants. Moss grows
&+mon their edges and on parts of the building as well. East leads back to town.&N

&+mA Field of Beets&N~
&+m   Row upon row of beets has been planted here, their large carrot-like leaves
&+mforming straight lines from the forest to the west to the farmhouse back east.
&+mThey grow in slightly raised lines of earth, and their purple and brown tops
&+mcan be occasionally seen protruding from the earth. While not particularly
&+mtasty or nourishing, they are easy to grow and harvest. The two feet between
&+madjacent rows is where the farmer can walk, inspecting his crops and watering
&+mthem if needed. The soil here must be rich and fertile, for the beets are big
&+mand thick. This is probably a result of the location of the plot, in the midst
&+mof a forest that has been cleared. East is the entrance to the field.&N

&+LA Small Shed&N~
&+m   A small shed stands in front of the treeline here, leaning backwards so
&+mmuch that it looks like it might topple at any moment. Several heaps of what
&+mlooks like compost lie on the ground to the west of it, a moldy coating on
&+mmost of this. The shed is a small squat building, and its relatively short
&+mheight may be the only reason it hasn't fallen over yet. Openings several
&+minches wide are between the boards and obviously no great effort was used
&+mwhen putting it together. There is no lock on the door, not that this would
&+mhelp any, but then again one is not visible on the door of the farmhouse to
&+mthe north. The beet field starts to the southwest, and northeast is the town.&N

&+yThe Start of a New Building&N~
&+g   Here on the southeastern section of the field, an opening has been made in
&+gthe forest. The trunks of the trees that have been cut down in this process
&+glie to the north, where they are more readily available to be hauled away. It
&+glooks as though a new building is going to be erected here, for the ground
&+ghas been meticulously cleared and some construction materials stand besides
&+gthe trunks. Perhaps a barn or shed, or even another house. This would make it
&+gthe southernmost house in this part of the village, bordering the forest that
&+gstretches between here and Tharnadia. There is currently no path leading here,
&+gand one has to walk through the beets to get here. The only exit is west.&N

&+bA Naturally Occurring Spring&N~
&+B   The plot of land ends here, enclosed to the north and west by the forest
&+Bwhich once covered the entire village. The earth here is a little more rocky
&+Bthan back east, and a particularly noticeable ridge of stone near the trees
&+Bis home to a small pool of water. This is not a remnant of rain that was
&+Bunable to seep through the stone, but a spring which is fed from far below.
&+BThe farmer makes obvious use of this, for several buckets and other objects
&+Bstand about, some of them dirty utensils that are waiting to be cleaned. The
&+Bbeets make way to a fenced in section of the land to the south, replaced by
&+Bgrass that the cows in there feed on. East of here are some fruit trees.&N

&+gyet and in all likelihood they do not produce much fruit yet, so the farmer
&+ghas to tend to them without reaping any rewards as of yet. The rows of beets
&+gstill run to the south, hundreds of rows going on for quite a distance before
&+gthey meet the treeline further in that direction. The southwest corner of the
&+gfield has been put to use to hold cattle, a fence blocking them from the beets.&N

&+LThe middle one is open, and one can see that it is in fact a bedstead. The
&+Lbed is not made and the blanket lies roughly draped over a mattress filled
&+Lwith straw. That wall is solid, without a door or window. The only openings
&+Lin this room are a door to the south and east, and a window to the south
&+Lthat is currently covered with a small blanket. The beams overhead have many
&+Lobjects hanging from them, ranging from meat that is drying to utensils and
&+Lclothing. The room is rather dark from the lack of windows, but the Spartan
&+Linterior is still readily discernible. It is rather chilly in here as well.&N

&+gThe path has been covered with &+Wcobblestones&+g, most of them a faded &+wgrey &+gcolour,
&+gand it runs further south into the woods. Perhaps one of the townsfolk chose
&+gto live further into the forest, some distance away from the rest of the town,
&+gor it leads to something the villagers regularly use such as &+Ybeehives &+gor &+bwater.
&+gJust a small distance away from the town, if one looks to the foliage on
&+geither side of the path, it may very well be in the middle of the Reaching
&+gWoods or even &+GTroll&+ybark &+gForest. The forest opens up a bit to the southwest.&N

&+gNevertheless, it is bustling with life, and despite its small size it is home
&+gto a myriad of creatures. The &+ypath &+gcontinues to the south, where it disappears
&+ginto the &+Ldeeper woods&+g. Back north is the cobblestone path which leads back to

&+bthe &+Bwater&+b. It is very peaceful here, and although the forest looms all about,
&+bit is as much an &+woasis &+bin the &+Lwoods &+bas a watering hole is in a the &+YAnauroch.&N

&+bAlongside a Small Pond&N~
&+g   The &+Wcobblestone &+gpath opens up into a small clearing in the woods here. To the
&+gwest lies a small &+Bpond&+g, covered on one side by foliage and trees while bordered
&+gon the other by a patch of &+yreeds &+gand this path. Its waters look more &+Lblack &+gthan
&+bblue&+g, and this does not wholly seem to be from the shade of the trees above.
&+gNevertheless, it is bustling with life, and despite its small size it is home
&+gto a myriad of creatures. The &+ypath &+gcontinues to the south, where it disappears
&+ginto the &+Ldeeper woods&+g. Back north is the cobblestone path which leads back to
&+gthe village. This may be a place some of the townsfolk visit occasionally when
&+gthey want to be alone, or contemplate things alone in the middle of &+Gthe forest.&N

&+gA Less Traveled Path into the Woods&N~
&+g   A small path continues into the woods south of the pond here. It is covered
&+gwith shrubs and small plants, which indicates that it is not traveled much.
&+gIt cannot be told where it leads from here, perhaps it would be wise to ask
&+gone of the villagers, but then again this close to Tharnadia it is unlikely
&+gthat one would run across much evil. Some distance to the south a hill can
&+gbe seen rising above the canopy, but not much of it can be made out from here.
&+gThe quaint pond is northwest of here, and it seems pointless to head into the
&+gwoods in any other direction than north or south as they are very thick. It
&+gis slightly colder here than it was nearer the village, as the trees block
&+gmuch of the light and the woods seem to be at a lower temperature than the
&+groads and villages around them.&N

&+gA Twist in the Less Traveled Path&N~
&+g   The path swerves to the right here, turning westward. A large rock blocks
&+gpassage to the south, several plants having managed to root themselves in tiny
&+gcracks in its side. Moss covers much of the lower and shaded sections of it,
&+glooking lush and green. Looking to the west one can see for only ten meters,
&+gas the trees and plants are equally rich and thick. There are a few old stumps
&+gvisible on this path and it must have been created by cutting down all trees
&+gthat once stood here. From most, small shoots are rising into the air again
&+gwhich indicates that they are not quite dead. Much of the path is overgrown
&+gwith small shrubs as a matter of fact, and it cannot be used often.&N

&+LDeeper in the Woods&N~
&+g   The path continues between some old trees, as one is now fully immersed in
&+gsea of vegetation. The sounds of the village are not to be heard here anymore,
&+gand as a matter of fact it is rather quiet even. The animals in this section
&+gof the forest have probably ceased their regular activities because of your
&+gpresence, or it may just be something else which has driven them away, because
&+gto the southwest a hill rises from the woods and it appears a house has been
&+gwrapped around its western side. The path appears to lead to the house's door,
&+gbut the vegetation hints that not much travel takes place here. Perhaps it
&+gwas once cleared, and since then it has been left alone and nature started
&+gto reclaim the ground. The shrubs reach up only to one's knees, but over time
&+gthe path will become harder and harder to traverse if nothing is done.&N

&+gBefore a Sizeable &+yHouse &+gBuilt On a &+wHill~
&+g   The hill really starts here, as it rises up sharply. It can be seen that it
&+gis mainly formed from an enormous boulder, which is probably why it has not
&+gbeen leveled with the surrounding area by the forces of nature. A stairway
&+gleads up at an angle of thirty or forty degrees, where after several meters a
&+gclosed door is the entranceway to a house that has been built on the hill. It
&+gdoes not contact the ground except with two large tree trunks which support
&+gthe eastern side of the house, and it clings to the mountain as if it were
&+gglued against it. Whether this is one of the town's villagers or an outsider
&+gis not immediately clear, but the distance from the village, strange design
&+gof the house and other less apparent clues hint at a strange occupant.&N

&+yThe Inside of a &+MStrange House&N~
&+r   A medium sized room is what one enters after climbing up the walkway into the
&+rhouse. It is maybe twenty feet wide and forty feet long, and it swerves to the
&+rleft as it sticks to the stone forming the mountain. A curtain or screen stands
&+rwest in the room, blocking something from sight, and a bulge to the east seems
&+rto form a viewing spot that allows one to see over the forest below the hill.
&+rThe room looks to have once been a casual living room, but it is now covered
&+rwith a thin line of dust and cobwebs can be seen in the corners. However it is
&+rstill clearly used, albeit mostly for storage it seems. Books, tomes and queer
&+rinstruments stand about, some dusty and some new and shiny. As the room goes
&+rfurther, a bare stairway leads up to the house's second floor.&N

&+yA Kitchen Built into the &+wMountain&N~
&+y   Obscured from sight by a screen standing between the room and this section,
&+yit is immediately clear that this is a small kitchen. It is built into the rock
&+yof the mountain, and a basin of water protrudes from the stone. Around this,
&+yseveral shelves are attached to the stone west of it, and to the east is the
&+yplank on which the house's owner prepares food. The basin is about three feet
&+ydeep and the water is cold and clear, and a hole in its back indicates that
&+yit comes from a spring or stream in the rock. The shelves and plank are lined
&+ywith used dishes and the worst of them looks to be several weeks old.&N

&+yA Small Room Overlooking the Road of North &+gKhomani-Khan~
&+r   A bulge in the house protrudes from the rest here, a large window spanning
&+rthe entire length of the wall. There is no glass set in it, instead several
&+rwooden shutters allow the openings to be closed against the wind, rain or
&+rcold. At this moment the center shutter is open, and one can see a road
&+rrunning from south to north some distance from the base of the mountain this
&+rhouse is built on. As one looks south, it leads up to the northern gates of
&+rTharnadia, city of splendor, and to the north it disappears in a bank of mist.
&+rSpanning the distance between the hill and the road are the woods, large old
&+rtrees forming a thick canopy. East is the room that led into the house.&N

&+rA Stairway to the Second Floor&N~
&+r   The room continues south towards some rickety old stairs. Although the wood
&+ralso covers the section between two treds, the whole does not look very solid
&+rand it might be smart to stay to the sides. A faded cloth handhold on either
&+rend provides some means of guidance, but the stairway is not very steep and
&+rthis is probably more ornamental. Looking up into the next room, the beams of
&+rthe house's roof can be seen, but nothing of the contents itself. Back to the
&+rnorth is the living room. When one looks out of the window which is still
&+rvisible from the lower part of the stairs, it becomes obvious that the hill's
&+rtop must be nearby, for the crowns of the trees below are quite some distance
&+raway from here and the mountain was not that high when seen from the ground.&N

&+bA Study Circling the &+wMountain's Crest&N~
&+M   Climbing up the stairs one comes into in a room that is built around a rock,
&+Mcircling to the left. This is the very top of the small hill, and the stone
&+Mforms the left side of this room. It has been smoothed somewhat and faintly
&+Mresembles a stone wall. To the west, there are several windows that offer a
&+Mview of the road north of Tharnadia. This road is perhaps three quarters of a
&+Mkilometer from here, and several hundred meters down as well. Inside the room,
&+Mvarious chairs have been pushed against the wall to make room for stacks of
&+Mstrange books. Metal and glass objects whose purpose can only be clear to the
&+Mowner of this house lie about, several of them tied together forming fragile
&+Mlooking contraptions. A door lies to the south and a naturally occurring cave
&+Mleads into the rock east of here, the path there blocked by many items.&N

&+rA Bedroom Overlooking Lake Skeldrach&N~
&+b   Once inside the cave it is apparent that this is actually a natural opening
&+bbetween two different boulders which form the mountain's top. The house's owner
&+bhas made good use of this to make a room out of it, wooden boards forming an
&+beven floor which supports a bed standing against the planks of the wall east
&+bof here. A single window allows a good view of the region east of here, for
&+bdespite the mountain's relative low height it certainly stands out over the
&+bsurrounding area. The room is bare of much else, a bed, nightstand and chest
&+bforming the only items inside. Its walls have not been made too expertly, for
&+bin many sections the cold wind from outside enters the bedroom. Consequently,
&+ba thick blanket covers the bed, and it must be very cozy to lie here with the
&+bwind howling outside along the mountain's top. The study is west of here.&N

&+L   This closet has large piles of supplies strewn about. It would seem that
&+Lthey were thrown in here quickly without any attempt to sort things out, for
&+Lmany of the stacks look like they are teetering on the edge of falling over.
&+LThere are no windows in this small room but one can see through the cracks
&+Lbetween the planks that the mountain dives sharply here, going back to ground
&+Llevel where the forest runs for a distance before meeting Tharnadia's northern
&+Lcity walls. The wind can be heard howling outside, and it is a little bit
&+Lunnerving to stand here. The study to the south looks a lot more inviting.&N

&+gBetween the Reeds Alongside a &+bSmall Pond&N~
&+y   The reeds are thick here, and only a thin strip of &+ggrassy land &+yis free to
&+ywalk upon between the water and the start of the trees. South of here the pond
&+ylies quaintly in the middle of the forest, its black water covered with many
&+yleaves and water plants. &+CRipples &+yon its surface reveal it bustles with life,
&+ycaused by both insects and small fish. The grass here has several small shrubs
&+ygrowing out of it but these are surely cleared every now and then, probably by
&+ysomeone from the village to the north. A section of the reeds has been removed
&+yas well and perhaps some of the townsfolk use this opening to fish in the &+bpond.
&+yOne can wade into the water from here, or head back east to the &+wcobblestone
&+wpath &+yalong the pool that leads back north and continues into the &+gwoods &+ysouth.&N

&+yThe Village's Stables&N~
&+Y   This building on the southeastern end of the square has many openings. The
&+Ydoor is the only real entrance, but many boards are missing from the walls
&+Yand they allow one to see what goes on outside without much trouble. There
&+Yare no windows, and this structure was probably once a large barn. It has
&+Ynow been converted to serve as stables, which basically means that all items
&+Ylying around the floor have been removed. Several wooden beams support the
&+Yroof, and poles perpendicular to the walls have been nailed between these
&+Ybeams. The horses are tethered to these, and some hay lies in the corner to
&+Ythe southeast right next to the door. Directly to the west are a small table
&+Yand a chair, which may be where the person running the stables sits.&N

&+gshrubs. The larger plants grow in the center of the path, which would be
&+gbetween the wheels of wagons passing through here. To the west are the trees
&+gwhich form the original vegetation here, and they look surprisingly dark and
&+gmenacing. The path gradually turns to the east where it runs some distance to
&+gthe south of a structure looking like a barn and smelling like a stable. The
&+garea to the east does not look like it is used for farming, but several fields
&+gwhere cattle may graze can be seen covering the clear areas. Behind these, the

&+g   A path leads away from the village center here. At this point, it has
&+greached the trees which form a barrier around the area to the west and south,
&+gand it continues to the east where one can see a field of wheat, its yellow
&+gcolour changing to a golden brown as the wind blows across it, sending small
&+gripples of a different colour gliding over the whole. Two wagon tracks on
&+geither side of the path hint at wagons passing through regularly, and one
&+gwould be wise not to walk in these for a tiny body of water hints at mud
&+gbelow. The trees to the north are thicker than to the south, where it appears
&+gthat they have once been cut down but have since been left to grow back. The
&+gvillage square is back to the west and one can travel east to the field.&N

&+BJurushka's Clothing&N~
&+Y   The northernmost store on the east side of the village square, this is
&+Yjust a small structure. It is some twelve by twelve feet and does not serve
&+Yas house for its owner, and looks just one step up from a simple stand. A
&+Ysmall counter covers the right half of the first area, and a rack of clothes
&+Yhangs west of that. Behind the counter and rack is a loom which takes up most
&+Yof the area left, although there are some cupboards on the walls. In addition,
&+Ytwo small shelves hang from the walls to the east and west before the counter,
&+Yvarious clothing on it. The garb displayed on the rack is obviously the cream
&+Yof the crop, finer clothing that is probably not meant for the townspeople
&+Ythemselves, while the items on the shelves are simpler and for everyday work.&N

&+LRalg's &+WWeapons &+Land &+YFarming Instruments&N~
&+L   While at first sight this store looks like a strange combination of farming
&+Lmaterial and weaponry, it may be very logical for the owner because the making
&+Lof either is somewhat similar. The store is a single storey building that is
&+Lsomewhat deep, that is, it is not very wide but the back wall is rather far
&+Lfrom the entrance. Farming material is on tables to the left and weaponry on
&+Lthe right, four tables on either side, and the forge and counter are in the
&+Lback of the store. Everything from hoes to rakes and from maces to swords is
&+Lavailable here, although one may wonder what use a seemingly peaceful farming
&+Lcommunity such as this has for weapons. Perhaps the proprietor also sells to
&+Lcaravans heading north from Tharnadia, or adventurers passing by, making it
&+Lworth their while to deviate from the road a little by offering lower prices
&+Lor better quality than in Tharnadia. The village's square is back to west.&N

&+LA stone stands to the west of it, looking like a protrusion from a ridge
&+Lthat runs along the path blocked by the fence. This path heads deeper into
&+Lthe woods, and it does not seem to have been used in a while for shrubs and
&+Lsaplings several feet high grow from it. To the east of the fence are several
&+Lthick trees and the area between them has been filled with boards. Why this
&+Lhappened is unknown and it seems futile, as one could go through the woods a

&+rA Guarded Encampment&N~
&+r   Another area has been cleared from the forest here, and it has been done
&+rmuch more recently. The trees have been cut down not too long ago and the
&+rscent of their sap is still in the air. Some of the trunks have been used to
&+rconstruct a makeshift building that looks suspiciously much like a barracks.
&+rThis is a farming town, and while there may be an armor store or two in the
&+rvillage center, the scene here is certainly out of place. Several men in
&+rarmor can be seen walking around doing various chores, while others are busy
&+rfixing the last details on the building. A thin line of smoke flows from a
&+rhole in the center of the roof, under which there is probably the cooking
&+rarea or a fire. The forest is thick in all directions save east, which is
&+rwhere the chained gate is - these men probably have something to do with it.&N

&+rA Guarded Encampment&N~
&+r   Another area has been cleared from the forest here, and it has been done
&+rmuch more recently. The trees have been cut down not too long ago and the
&+rscent of their sap is still in the air. Some of the trunks have been used to
&+rconstruct a makeshift building that looks suspiciously much like a barracks.
&+rThis is a farming town, and while there may be an armor store or two in the
&+rvillage center, the scene here is certainly out of place. Several men in
&+rarmor can be seen walking around doing various chores, while others are busy
&+rfixing the last details on the building. A thin line of smoke flows from a
&+rhole in the center of the roof, under which there is probably the cooking
&+rarea or a fire. The forest is thick in all directions save east, which is
&+rwhere the chained gate is - these men probably have something to do with it.&N

&+GA Grazing Field&N~
&+g   This field lies between the trees southwest of the village. Bushes and
&+gsmall saplings grow to the west of it, and a virtually impenetrable wall of
&+gtrees is to the north. The field is apparently used for keeping cattle, as
&+gseveral nearby heaps of dung show. They are buzzing with flies and some other
&+ginsects can be seen burrowing in them. The field itself rolls gently, varying
&+gin height but only with a few meters, and is covered with small shrubs that
&+ghave mostly been eaten bare by the cattle and long, thin grass. A path leads
&+gto the east here, where it continues for perhaps thirty meters until it runs
&+ginto the trees which presumably form the end of the village. A shed stands at
&+gthe end of the path, and a small building is between the trees to its south.&N

&+yA Path to the East of the &+GGrazing Field&N~
&+m   A path emerges from the grass here, pushing the trees aside in a figurative
&+msense and traveling east for some distance until it meets a shed set between
&+mthe trees. The forest is immediately to the north, and many of the branches
&+monce growing from the trees have been cut down, at least those growing up to
&+mthe height of a human. Overhead, the branches stretch for a quite a distance
&+mand they even reach over the roof of the house to the south. There, a small
&+mcottage stands between the trees, flanked on either side by trunks. It seems
&+membedded in the woods, and surely it has no garden and very little sunlight.
&+mA door is in the wall, and the path continues east to the shed.&N

&+yA Shed Set Between the &+gTrees&N~
&+L   The path ends here at a small shed. Now that one is this close, it can be
&+Lseen that it has only two walls. Apparently it never had a front one, and the
&+Lone to the west has fallen over where it lies between the trees. The shed
&+Lstill stands, which is partly because some thick branches have grown under
&+Lthe roof and serve to hold it up. It contains a pile of hay which has been
&+Lplaced in the corner of the two remaining walls, several barrels and tools
&+Lwhich are placed on a dirty table. In due time the woods will reclaim this
&+Larea, unless the foliage immediately around it is cleared and the shed is
&+Lgiven a fix. One could probably travel into the woods but they look very
&+Lthick and unfriendly, so the path back west is the only realistic option.&N

&+yA Small &+yCottage &+yin the Woods&N~
&+y   Located a bit east of the grazing field and separated from it by a group
&+yof trees, this house stands in the middle of the woods. It is a small home,
&+ywith no second floor, but it has a relatively high ceiling and a small ladder
&+yleads up to a platform which may be used for storage. There is a window to
&+ythe north, which does not provide much of a view since the trees on the path's
&+yother side are nearby, and there is little natural light. A door leads south
&+ybut it has been blocked in a strange way, small boards have been nailed over
&+yit and it cannot be used anymore. A table stands against the north wall, a
&+ybed next to it against the east wall, and otherwise it is empty save for some
&+yshelves on the south wall. This is obviously not a farm, and it makes for a
&+yrather poor home, so perhaps it is used by someone tending to the cattle on
&+ythe fields west of here for small periods of time, or used by a hunter.&N

&+LA Darker Path into the Forest&N~
&+L   The path leading away from the gate has not been used for some time, and
&+Lit is covered with small shrubs and saplings reaching up to a human's waist.
&+LIn not too long a while, it will become difficult to traverse and after that
&+Lit will be reclaimed by the forest completely. What the path leads to is not
&+Lclear, and why it has been closed is also a mystery. One thing that is clear
&+Lhowever is that the woods are surprisingly thick, and while of course this
&+Lis impossible, it seems they are hostile as well. Small branches and twigs
&+Lstick behind the clothing of anyone passing here, and every one of these
&+Lseems to be covered with tiny thorns. The earth is covered with a moss as it
&+Lis quite damp, but this has the effect that one can no longer make out the
&+Lholes in the ground which makes travel tedious. The woods are impassable to
&+Lthe north, but a thick bush standing between trees to the south may allow
&+Lpassage in that direction if one takes a closer look.&N

&+gIn the Thick Woods Far Southeast of the Village&N~
&+L   The woods are still very thick here, but there is less foliage and the
&+Lshrubs are not as prolific which allows one to walk between the large trunks.
&+LThese trees must be quite old, several of them over a century, and they bear
&+Lno scars of human intrusion in the area. While there are many different kinds
&+Lof trees around here, they all have in common that their trunks are rather
&+Lblack, and closer examination reveals this to be a small spotted fungus. It
&+Lclings to their bark without growing outward, so the trees look exactly as
&+Lthey did before, save for their being black now. A moldy layer covers the

&+Lcrack when one walks over them. There is little to no animal activity to be

&+gA More &+wRock Covered &+gSection of the Woods&N~
&+w   The trees are less dense here, while in places rocks jut out of the earth
&+wbelow. Looking through the trees to the west, one can make out a ridge of
&+wstone protruding from the earth and rising to a respectable height of twenty
&+wodd feet but at such a sharp angle that traversing it would be impossible.
&+wThe ground slopes downward gently to the east, where if one looks carefully
&+wit is possible to make out tall, thin trees with no branches below their
&+wcrowns, and pools of black water between them. Travel to the north is not
&+wpossible as a patch of brambles has occupied the area between the rock there,
&+wproviding a home for some small game that may live here due to the proximity
&+wof water to the southeast. The path continues both east and west.&N

&+wA &+yPath &+wAlong a Ridge of Rock&N~
&+w   The path from the east ends here before the mass of the ridge, but a small
&+wpassageway continues to the north. For several feet east of the ridge, the
&+wearth is not covered with brambles, while a truly enormous patch of them
&+wgrows beyond that which makes passage to the northeast impossible. The ridge
&+wis some twenty feet high. and is made of solid stone. Its top looks sharp,
&+wand the rock looks like a triangle with its widest section set in the ground
&+wbelow. It curves slightly to the south where it disappears behind some trees
&+wand to the north is another ridge which meets up with it. Whether one can
&+wcontinue in that direction will have to be seen, but for now on can travel
&+wnorth along the ridge, east into the woods and south to the ridge's end.&N

&+LA Sheltered Section of the Woods&N~
&+g   The ridge ends here, but not before it curves to the east and blocks the
&+gpassage to the south. An opening in the rock provides some shelter, and one
&+gof the boulders which protrudes from the earth to the east has nestled itself
&+gright next to the ridge's and. This shelters the area here, and it would make
&+gfor a relatively safe and dry camping spot. As the ridge ends, it does not
&+gdiminish in size, and it is still twenty feet in height. It would be nigh
&+gimpossible to climb it and there is very little vegetation growing from it,
&+gwhich means its surface is so smooth that the plants cannot get a foothold.
&+gSeveral bird nests can be seen in nooks and crannies, surely cramped, but
&+gsafer than in the trees of the forest to the east. One can only go north.&N

&+wA &+yPath &+wAlong a Ridge of Rock&N~
&+y   Travel is possible along the ridge for nothing grows right next to it,
&+ybut one must be careful because the rock offers no handholds and there is
&+ya thick patch of brambles to the east which has taken advantage of the lack
&+yof trees besides the stone. A second ridge protrudes from the earth to the
&+ynorth and runs east, but where they meet the two slabs of stone do not
&+ydirectly connect and it looks to be possible to walk between them. One can
&+ytravel south from here, where a small patch leads east into the woods,
&+ybut looking that way one cannot see anything but dark trees after several
&+ymeters. The stone of the ridge is a grey colour and it looks very solid.&N

&+LThe Mouth of a Dark Cave&N~
&+L   This is where the east-west and north-south ridge meet. Their two masses
&+Ldo not actually touch until some distance to the north, while they also meet
&+Lsome distance overhead. The resulting cave is dark and it narrows as it goes
&+Lfurther north, where the ground is replaced by stone. At the rear section of
&+Lthe cave, a black hole in the ground leads down into the earth. The cave has
&+Lsome bones lying around in it, and some dirty grass, and there are several
&+Ltrails visible. Someone or something has been here, and entered the hole.
&+LOne can travel south along the ridge's length where a path runs between the
&+Lstone and a patch of brambles, or climb down into the darkness of the hole.&N

&+LA Menacing Tunnel Below the Forest&N~
&+b   A dark tunnel leads below the ridge here, heading generally northeast. The
&+bwalls are solid rock, and this is probably an opening in the stone of the
&+bridge overhead, for the tunnel would have to be considerably deeper to run
&+bbelow the stone itself. The bottom of the tunnel is soggy but not muddy, and
&+bin places there is stone visible which may just mean that the ridge continues
&+bdown for a greater distance and that this passage runs right through it. The
&+bair is stale and there is no sign of any creatures making their home here,
&+bperhaps it is too dark save for insects. One has to travel here in a hunched
&+bmanner, for the tunnel is no higher than four feet. An opening above provides
&+ban exit from the cramped space here, leading into some kind of cave.&N

&+yA Crevasse Leading &+LDown&N~
&+y   The opening in the rock twists and turns for what seems to be an eternity,
&+yonly a few feet wide. The rock is a bleached white, in place sandstone yellow,
&+yand rises to a good height above. It looks as if this rock cracked in the heat
&+yof the sun, which is unlikely here north of Tharnadia, but it is a good enough
&+yanalogy. The crevasse here is where the two pieces split. Coming to the end of
&+ythe crevasse, there is a dark opening in the stone below. It is not covered
&+ywith stones and rocks like the rest of the narrow path leading here, and one
&+ycould go down below. This hole looks natural enough, but its mouth may have
&+ybeen widened at one point. Perhaps it serves as home, or den, to something.&N

&+yA Crevasse Between the &+wStone&N~
&+y   In the surface of the rock is this crevasse. It leads into the stone, and
&+yis only a few feet wide. Below, small rocks and stones that may have crumbled
&+yfrom the edges far above line the path. This looks like a natural passage in
&+ythat the stone looks to have cracked and split in two parts, forming this
&+y&+ycrevasse. How far it goes cannot be said, perhaps it leads to the forest that
&+ypresumably lies to the east of the boulder, or it may end halfway into the
&+ystone. West of here is the shrub covered rocky stretch of land, but this is
&+yquickly obscured from sight because the crevasse twists and turns as it goes.&N

&+YA Shrub Covered &+wRocky &+YStretch of Land&N~
&+Y   The rock to the north continues here, and the land is somewhat more barren
&+Ythan to the west. The plants and small trees have given way to shrubs and the
&+Yearth looks a little dusty and sandy. Small rocks are strewn all over and most
&+Yof them are lying loosely on the ground. Looking to the east, a jagged section
&+Yof cliffs rises from the ground. While not very high, they are highly irregular
&+Yand look totally impassible. They run some distance to the south where another
&+Ylarge boulder lies on the ground. Some distance to the south, a forest starts
&+Ywhere that boulder ends. The earth here does not look very fertile, but it may
&+Ybe an ideal place for a particular kind of rodent. Out of harm's way, several
&+Yof them are running around from bush to bush, doing whatever it is they do. In
&+Ythe earth, there are no holes or burrows visible, and these creatures must be
&+Yquite adapt at making their homes between roots or stones where they are hard
&+Yto spot. A boulder like that some distance to the north blocks passage to the
&+Ysouth, and one can only travel west along it or north into the shrubs. It may
&+Ybe possible to go east as well, as there is a narrow crevasse in the rock face.&N

&+wAn Opening in the Rock&N~
&+L   On the east side of the stretch of land is a small cave. It is not very
&+Ldeep and is not hidden from sight, but at least it provides some protection
&+Lfrom the elements as the rain has no chance of entering it. The cave is some
&+Lten feet deep, and one can see that the inside of the rock is the same color
&+Las the outer surface. The cave shows no signs of being inhabited, although
&+Lsome trigs on the floor hint that it may at times be used by animals, or
&+Lhunters from the village. It is a naturally occurring opening, and the floor
&+Lis relatively smooth. Looking to the west, one can see more rocks and stones,
&+Lmost a few feet high, standing on a rocky stretch of land with several shrubs
&+Lin between them. Further away, the outline of a forest can be seen.&N

&+y   A narrow path runs between the rocks here, most of which are eight odd
&+yfeet in height. It swerves between them, and looks like it may be used by
&+ysome of the local animals as well, for small imprints in the dirt are tell-
&+ytale signs of their presence. The path leads generally south, but after only
&+ya few turns it already seems to be far away from the section to the north,
&+yand nothing can be seen except rocks and the large boulder to the north. The
&+yforest was some distance to the south, and it is possible that this path may
&+ylead to it. In places, plants and shrubs grow from the earth between the rock.&N

&+GA &+WF&+ma&+Me&+br&+Bi&+We &+GRing Between a Group of &+wRocks &+Gand the &+gForest&N~
&+G   The path ends here, like the exit from a maze. It can be seen that the
&+Gboulder to the north is some sixty feet or more away now, but with the rock
&+Gbetween it and here, the actual distance on foot is much greater. There is
&+Ga small patch of incredibly green grass here, growing on what seems to be a
&+Gsmooth limestone surface, and a brook gently rolls to the south. Behind the
&+Gwater are the woods, but there is are no trees here to block the rays of the
&+Gsun. To the north, east and west rocks protrude from the ground, blocking
&+Gpassage in those directions, with the exception of a narrow twisting path to
&+Gthe north. The grass growing from the earth encased by the limestone has a
&+Gsmall ring of mushrooms in it, forming a perfect circle, and flowers are set
&+Gin the whole, their petals all different colours and combining into a virtual
&+Grainbow as a breeze passes and waves their stalks gently. There are several
&+Gsmall stones in the water, but it is very shallow and many of them protrude
&+Gfrom its surface. The sound of the water flowing against them, causing small
&+Gbubbles to form and burst which makes for a very soothing natural lullaby.&N

&+gThe Edge of the Woods&n~
&+g   It appears that the heart of the forest lies to the south for the woods
&+gbecome less thick in the opposite direction, but nevertheless even the small
&+gshrubs make travel frustrating. The distance between the trees grows larger,
&+gindicating the forest comes to an end, and looking to the north one can see
&+gseveral larger stones in the earth. It can now be seen that beyond these is
&+ga large boulder perhaps fifty feet high, emerging from the shrubs which have
&+greplaced the trees at that point. The earth at this point is less dark, a
&+gnatural result of the less dense vegetation, and some smaller rocks can be
&+gseen in the immediate area. One can travel in every cardinal direction from
&+ghere, although for how far remains to be seen. A path starts to the south.&N

&+y   One can travel no further north here, for the rock emerges from the earth
&+ylike an out of place wall. It is a brown colour, which somewhat mixes with
&+ythe trees to the west and south, but in many places green patches of plants
&+yhave found a foothold in its cracks. It may just be possible to climb up,
&+yfor the stone is far from smooth and there are many handholds. One can also
&+yhead west into the woods, or east where a natural path runs perpendicular to
&+ythe rock itself. Looking in that direction, there is no immediate forest to
&+ybe seen, just small rocks and shrubs which disappear in a thin mist after
&+ysome hundred feet. An open space is to the south before the forest starts.&N

&+G   While the area to the east is mostly a miniature mountainous terrain that
&+Gis composed mostly of rocks and shrubs, the forest grows prolifically once
&+Gagain to the west. It stops almost unnaturally, as if a magical force prevents
&+Git from covering the land back east, and the border is a strange sight. It is
&+Gnot possible to enter the woods, and nothing can be seen but thick branches,
&+Ga great deal of bushes between the trees and even some vines. The only obvious
&+Gexit is back east, where no such forest grows. Mushrooms and moss grow between
&+Gthe roots of the trees, testimony to the fertility of the land.&N

&+bA Tiny &+BStream &+bat the Foot of a &+wLarge Rock&N~
&+B   At the western corner of the rock a small hole can be seen in the stone,
&+Bfrom which a small but constant stream of water flows in a twisting little
&+Briver towards the woods where it disappears out of sight quickly. Looking up,
&+Bthe boulder does not seem that massive, and it is unlikely that there is
&+Banything on top of it which could provide a constant flow of water. Perhaps
&+Bthere is a bowl-like shape on its top, where rainwater has gathered which
&+Bfinds its way through the tiniest cracks in the stone before emerging here.
&+BThe trees to the west are very thick, and a stone blocks passage to the
&+Bsouth, while the large rock emerges to the north. East of here is an opening.&N

&+y   The surface of the boulder is highly irregular here, and as a result it is
&+ypossible to climb it even though it rises at a sharp angle. The many cracks
&+yand protrusions provide for excellent handholds, although most of them have
&+yplants growing out of them and some care needs to be taken not to slip. The
&+yrock rises for some thirty feet, which is not particularly high, but as there
&+yis nothing else nearby which can match it, the view may be excellent. This is
&+yhalfway up the rock face, and even from this location one already looks out
&+yover much of the surrounding area save for the larger trees to the south. One
&+ycan climb further up to the boulder's top, or head back down to the ground.&N

&+yA Barn Filled With Farming Materials&N~
&+y   Standing to the north of the wheat field, this barn is built on a strip
&+yof land between the field's edge and the treeline to the north. It is a
&+ysimple construction, basically consisting of four thick poles upon which a
&+yroof has been placed, and some boards covering the open space to create the
&+ywalls. The barn is not filled with a lot of material, but that which can be
&+yseen is obviously farming material. A plough stands in the middle of the
&+yfloor, dry mud clinging to the metal pins, and hoes, scythes and shovels
&+yhang from the wall suspended between some nails driven into the wood. The
&+yonly exit is back south, where the wheat starts after just a few feet.&N

&+gA Fenced Field With &+yHorses&N~
&+G  The plot of land to the east of the barn has been fenced in and it is home
&+Gto a handful of horses. They do not look like riding horses, nor warhorses,
&+Ginstead they are sturdy animals that would serve well pulling a plough. Most
&+Gof the grass has been grazed down to a very short height, and the leaves of
&+Gthe trees to the north within reach of the horses has been eaten away as well.
&+GThey do not seem shy or frightened, instead trotting toward the fence when
&+Gthey see someone approaching, perhaps hoping for a carrot or a caring word.
&+GThe field of wheat is to the south, spanning several hundred feet before it
&+Gstops again before a farmhouse. Far to the southwest is the field's entrance,
&+Ga path disappearing toward the village between the trees on that side. To the
&+Gsoutheast is a closed fence, perhaps leading to another plot of farmland.&N

&+yA Small, &+LOlder &+yFarmhouse&N~
&+c   This is the inside of a small farmhouse which overlooks the field of wheat.
&+cIt looks to have been around for a while, showing all signs of a building that
&+cis a little older such as cracks in the wood and dust on the beams overhead.
&+cHowever, it also has the tell-tale signs of a house that has been lived in and
&+cit is quaint and homely. Tin plates hang over the south wall, each showing a
&+cdifferent relief in its base, perhaps handmade by the farmer's family, and a
&+cdinner table with four chairs stands to the northwest before a window. South
&+cof that is a sitting area, with several chairs around a lower table, and to
&+cthe east is a kitchen and the bedsteads are in the southeastern wall. A door
&+cleads out to the east, and one can see through the window that is leads to
&+ca small vegetable garden. A second door leads north out of the farmhouse.&N

&+GA Small Garden of Vegetables&N~
&+G   The piece of land right next to the farmhouse has been turned into a
&+Gsmall garden. It measures only forty square feet or so, but it is probably
&+Genough for a single family. If not, then at least it provides some extra
&+Gfood to go with the normal fare. There is no fence around it, and some of
&+Gthe vegetables show signs of being nibbled on by rodents or bugs, but it
&+Gmust not be possible to stop these pests from venturing here and eating a
&+Gpart of the crops or the farmer would have already done so. The grass to
&+Gthe south and east of the garden quickly gives way to small shrubs, which
&+Gare in turn usurped by the forest. A pile of lumber blocks the north exit.&N
