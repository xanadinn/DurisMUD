&+LA &+gS&+cw&+ga&+Gm&+gp&+cy&+y Trail&n~
   This swampy trail runs through one of the many swamps in Duris, and
is surrounded with willow trees, beautiful flowers, murky things, and
dark places.  The trail seems to have been formed from the passings of
many slimy feet upon the wet cat-tails and the tall grass.  There are
reminents of old battles here.  There appears to be some lizard skin
near the side of the trail.

&+LBefore a &+GWe&+ge&+Gp&+gin&+Gg&+L Willow&+y Tree&n~
    A huge willow tree rises up into the swamp here, hanging its long
dangling branches down into the swamp, creating a drape that falls over
a huge area of the swamp.  Its roots, almost ten feet in diamater, spawn
out in all directions creating a huge web of roots.  There appears to be
a small entrance to some sort of underground cavern that has been wedged
inbetween the roots of this huge tree.

&+LThe Entrance to the &+yVillage&+L of the Li&+wz&+La&+wrd&+Lmen&n~
    A huge network of dwellings of the feared lizard men.  The network
spawns out in a serries of tunnels and caves.  There is a large amount
of water in these caverns and tunnels, but there is still a little bit
of breathing room.  The caverns seems to have been dug out by the
lizard men themselves, or else by their pets.

&+WSkeletons&+L, &+yskins&+L, &+Wskulls&+L, &+rscalps&+L, and any numerous other trophies from raids
&+Lpast are mounted upon the east and west walls of this chamber.  The &+ypassageway
&+Lleads off to the north, into the dank darkness of the &+yunderground&+L.  Hanging
&+Lfrom the roots that make up the ceiling, various animal &+Wbones&+L are displayed on
&+yleather&+L straps.  To the south, the domicile leads back into the &+yvillage&+L.&n

&+gThe Throne Room~
      This throne room seems to be scattered with so many bones it's
hard to tell where the walls begin and the bones end, maybe even
the walls are made out bones.  The lizard king sits atop a large
bone throne here, enjoying the newest spoils from whatever raid
he has gone on. He has a special guard who stands here at his
side, almost like he is some kind of bodyguard to the king of
the lizard men.  There are huge chunks of rotten flesh that have
been slung about the cave as the lizard king has obviously gotten
bored with eating that particular animal.

&+LA &+wCommon&+L Dwelling&n~
     This slimy dwelling appears to be scattered with bones of humans,
and other humanoid species that the lizard men have captured and eaten.
Lizard men appear to sleep anywhere they please, often on a rock by
a pool of water in the center of the room. Every now and then someone
might see a lizard man eating some kind of mushrooms or other swamp
plants, but most often screams of terrified villagers from human towns
can be heard as they are dragged, face first, through the water of
the lizard men village into these spacious dwellings where the lizard
men will eat them, sometimes alive.  Bones of the eaten humans and
other humanoids are used as weapons sometimes, and often used to
make shields.  Others have found it nice to use the bones to make
different kinds of jewelry such as necklaces, amulets, and other
types of things.

     This slimy dwelling appears to be scattered with bones of humans,
and other humanoid species that the lizard men have captured and eaten.
Lizard men appear to sleep anywhere they please, often on a rock by
a pool of water in the center of the room. Every now and then someone
might see a lizard man eating some kind of mushrooms or other swamp
plants, but most often screams of terrified villagers from human towns
can be heard as they are dragged, face first, through the water of
the lizard men village into these spacious dwellings where the lizard
men will eat them, sometimes alive.  Bones of the eaten humans and
other humanoids are used as weapons sometimes, and often used to
make shields.  Others have found it nice to use the bones to make
different kinds of jewelry such as necklaces, amulets, and other
types of things.

     The swamp of horror is one of the worst places to end up on the world
of the world, some say they'd rather have end up in the presence of Cython,
or even worse, in the dreaded Temple of Cython, where the evil clerics
eat your heart and sacrafice you to the Darklord himself.  This swamp is
filled with some of the most vile things in the realm.  Only the highest
paladin is even able to attempt to come near this swamp, others are
sent fleeing in fear back to their guilds.  The swamp seems to be set
in perpetual twilight, as Dakhira's insanity reigns supreme over this
swamp of horror.  Old corpses can be seen trying to reach up out
of the swamp as if even in death they're trying to escape the grip of
this swamp.  This swamp invites the very evil of Duris to come here
and feed on the misfortunate.  All kinds of evils can be seen roaming
the swamp trying to prey on the misfortuned souls who have stumbled
upon this great swamp of death.  If there is a heaven for necromancers,
this would be it.  The death here even has its own particular smell.

this would be it.  The death here even has its own particular smell.

     The swamp of horror is one of the worst places to end up on the world
of the world, some say they'd rather have end up in the presence of Cython,
or even worse, in the dreaded Temple of Cython, where the evil clerics
eat your heart and sacrafice you to the Darklord himself.  This swamp is
filled with some of the most vile things in the realm.  Only the highest
paladin is even able to attempt to come near this swamp, others are
sent fleeing in fear back to their guilds.  The swamp seems to be set
in perpetual twilight, as Dakhira's insanity reigns supreme over this
swamp of horror.  Old corpses can be seen trying to reach up out
of the swamp as if even in death they're trying to escape the grip of
this swamp.  This swamp invites the very evil of Duris to come here
and feed on the misfortunate.  All kinds of evils can be seen roaming

     The swamp of horror is one of the worst places to end up on the world
of the world, some say they'd rather have end up in the presence of Cython,
or even worse, in the dreaded Temple of Cython, where the evil clerics
eat your heart and sacrafice you to the Darklord himself.  This swamp is
filled with some of the most vile things in the realm.  Only the highest
paladin is even able to attempt to come near this swamp, others are
sent fleeing in fear back to their guilds.  The swamp seems to be set
in perpetual twilight, as Dakhira's insanity reigns supreme over this
swamp of horror.  Old corpses can be seen trying to reach up out
of the swamp as if even in death they're trying to escape the grip of
this swamp.  This swamp invites the very evil of Duris to come here
and feed on the misfortunate.  All kinds of evils can be seen roaming
the swamp trying to prey on the misfortuned souls who have stumbled
upon this great swamp of death.  If there is a heaven for necromancers,
this would be it.  The death here even has its own particular smell.

      A trail to one of the darkest places on Duris lies ahead, a trail
into the swamp of horrors.  Orcish hordes, Troll raiders, Ogre shaman,
even Drow sorcerers flock here to bathe in the vast slaughtering and
to bring on Dakhira's insanity upon them, to force them into a BloodLust!
This area reeks of evil.  Corpses of many thigns lie around here,
scattered and torn up by who knows what.

and other humanoid species that the lizard men have captured and eaten.
Lizard men appear to sleep anywhere they please, often on a rock by
a pool of water in the center of the room. Every now and then someone
might see a lizard man eating some kind of mushrooms or other swamp
plants, but most often screams of terrified villagers from human towns
can be heard as they are dragged, face first, through the water of
the lizard men village into these spacious dwellings where the lizard
men will eat them, sometimes alive.  Bones of the eaten humans and
other humanoids are used as weapons sometimes, and often used to
make shields.  Others have found it nice to use the bones to make
different kinds of jewelry such as necklaces, amulets, and other
types of things.  This particular dwelling seems to be used by almost
all of the lizard men as they prepare to go on raids.  It seems to suit
all purposes, a hatchery, a battle ready room, an armory, and a
common meeting room for the lizard men.
