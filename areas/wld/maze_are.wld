&+yA Gateway to the &+LOld &+yGraveyard~
  &+yThis is a well-kept gravel road that leads east through the graveyard.
&+yRandom tombs of unknown warriors lay in rows as far as the eye can see.
&+yMany of the graves are empty and desecrated and the graves here seem very
&+yrecent. There are piles of &+rfresh bodies &+yawaiting burial. A high stone
&+ywall made of large &+Lgrey &+yrocks surrounds the graveyard that is high enough
&+yto deter any foolish person from trying to climb over it.

&+LThe Dark &+yTunnel~
  &+LThese passage rooms seem all the same. Walls made of heavy chunks of stone
&+Lrise tens of feet and are lined by candles &+Yburn &+Wdimly &+Lin sconces every other
&+Lmeter. The walls have been struck by something powerful as deep claw marks run
&+Lalong the surface. The soft sound of dripping water can be heard throughout
&+Lthe tunnel as the sound echos against the barren walls. Occasionally wailing
&+Lscreams or the clanking of dry bones break the silence. The tunnel leads north
&+Lsouth and west into the unknown darkness.

  &+LThese passage rooms seem all the same. Walls made of heavy chunks of stone
&+Lrise tens of feet and are lined by candles &+Yburn &+Wdimly &+Lin sconces every other
&+Lmeter. The walls have been struck by something powerful as deep claw marks run
&+Lalong the surface. The soft sound of dripping water can be heard throughout
&+Lthe tunnel as the sound echos against the barren walls. Occasionally wailing
&+Lscreams or the clanking of dry bones break the silence. The tunnel leads north

&+LThe Dead End of the &+yTunnel~
  &+LThis room is obviously a blind end. Wall is built from large grey rocks that
&+Lhave been fastened to each other with some kind of mortar. The walls are
&+Lcovered with a smelly &+Gslime &+Land small &+gro&+ytt&+ging &+Lpieces of a &+rmeat &+Llike substance,
&+Lfills the air with an unbearable stench. The floor is coated with some kind of
&+Lmolded &+Gslime &+Lis made of black marble. This end of the tunnel is extremely
&+Lunstable.Large loose blocks of masonry have fallen before and could fall again.

&+LThe Dark &+yTunnel~
  &+LThese passage rooms seem all the same. Walls made of heavy chunks of stone
&+Lrise tens of feet and are lined by candles &+Yburn &+Wdimly &+Lin sconces every other
&+Lmeter. The walls have been struck by something powerful as deep claw marks run
&+Lalong the surface. The soft sound of dripping water can be heard throughout
&+Lthe tunnel as the sound echos against the barren walls. Occasionally wailing
&+Lscreams or the clanking of dry bones break the silence. The tunnel leads north
&+Lsouth and west into the unknown darkness.

  &+LThese passage rooms seem all the same. The walls are heavy stone blocks, that
&+Lrise tens of feet above head, a couple of candles &+Yburn &+Wdimly &+Lin sconces here
&+Land there. The walls have been hewn by a mighty force look as though they were
&+Lclawed. There are traces of &+Rblood &+Lin the claw marks. The soft sound of
&+Ldropping &+bwater &+Lsends echoes throughout the tunnel. Moss covers the walls and
&+Lferns even grow in the cracks here and there. Can hear the random groan of
&+La &+wghost&+L, the howl of a &+gzombies&+L, and the dry clanking of bones. The forces of
&+Levil have taken control of this maze. The tunnel travels north leading into
&+La darkness. A &+bwell &+Lin the middle of the floor leads up into a tower.

&+LThe Mazekeeper's &+cTower~
  The office is &+ydusty&N and dark like the rest of the &+yMaze&N, but is otherwise in
the same condition as when it was occupied. Table sits in the middle of
the room is made from solid oak but appears to be very used. Its surface is
covered in marks and scratches. A large burning candle stands directly on
the table surface, tallow flowing down its sides. A &+ybookcase&N rests against
the wall. Various chairs are set in front of the desk. The floor is covered
with half-erased pentagrams and even weirder symbols. A blackboard in
a dark corner has only been partially cleaned, some painful-looking letters
faintly visible. The walls of this strange room glow and hum as if it is alive.
A giant candle flickering with soft &+Bblue &+Yflames&N provides the only light here.
A long glass tubes and scores of oddly shaped vials and bottles are everywhere.
It is incredibly messy here, crushed glass and other trash litter the floor.
An old stench emanates from it, as dust seems to continually flow from the old
arch. A well in the middle of the floor leads down into darkness.

&+yThe &+rGuardians &+yStation~
  &+yThis room appears to have once been very ornately furnished, but now
&+yeverything is decayed and moldering. Torch brackets occupy the four corners
&+yof this huge room. Above each torch is a life-like ornate &+Lstone &+ygargoyle.
&+yMurals on the wall show battle scenes in gargoyles, minotaurs and huge, flying
&+ysnake-like reptiles with poisonous tails fight humans and dwarves. The floor is
&+ymade of &+Lblack &+ymarble as is the ceiling. The &+rcorpses &+yare on the floor, bodies
&+ylooked as if they have been pierced by a large, jagged spear. They look as if
&+ytheir necks have been broken and their flesh chewed. The damage these people
&+ysustained is simply amazing. Worse, the lips on the bodies are a light shade of
&+yblue, hinting at poison in their systems. The stench of &+rblood &+yfills nostrils...

&+LThe &+mForbidden &+LCatacomb~
  &+LThis cave system must have been built long ago. Once beautiful, this place
&+Lhas been turned into a &+Rslaughterhouse &+Lby the hands of evil beings... even more
&+Rblood &+Land dead, &+rrotting &+rflesh&+L. Moss covers the walls and ferns
&+Lgrow in the cracks here and there. The air is dank and smells of something
&+Ldead... or maybe undead. Stone walls, musty air... the earth seems to moan
&+Lsoftly. The mind whirls in the hideous madness of this place. The stench is
&+Lhorrendous and dead bodies, sucked of life, lay all over. The floor of this
&+Lcatacomb is littered with the lids of smashed sarcophagi, bits of treasure
&+Ldropped by thieves and looters, and corpses pulled from their resting places.
&+LMassive doors lead off to the south. It's hard to understand the strange &+mglyphs

&+Lmassive &+Lcreatures of apparently tremendous strength.

&+LThe Entrance to the &+yMaze &+Lof &+yDeath~
   &+LThis is the entrance to a huge and confusing maze. Terrible sounds can be
&+Lheard, the &+Mscreaming &+Lof thousands of souls &+Mscreaming &+Ltheir last cries into
&+Lthe darkness. Strange moaning and growling come from all directions.
&+LOn the floor are charcoal stencils of &+rpentagrams &+Land various other ominous
&+Lsigils. The walls are coated with &+Rblood&+L, bits of &+Rbloody &+rflesh &+Llie on
&+Lthe floor, and torn clothing is scattered about. This place looks like
&+Lthe feeding grounds of a beasts and monsters. The &+yMaze &+Lof &+yDeath &+Lknown as
&+Lshadow dungeon has long been known as a place in which even those adventurers
&+Lwith the best direction sense may be confused. A large &+gwo&+yo&+gden &+ystaircase &+Lleads
&+Lup into the &+Csurface&+L. Staircase is very worn and cracks in the surface mingle
&+Lwith the cores of mineral that penetrates the rock from which these steps
&+Lare chiselled.

&+yleans against the western wall. The sarcophagus is opened up reveal remains
&+yof something other than man. The &+gmu&+cmm&+gified&+y body lies out in the open, ripped
&+yto pieces. Gnawed pieces of flesh and&N bone &+yare strewn here. The smell coming
&+yoff of the opened sarcophagus is nauseating. The floor is slightly crumpled and
&+ywalls are raked. A flickering &+Yflame &+yis in the center of the room, seeming
&+yto feed off of darkness and cleansing the room of any evil. The walls floor and
&+yceiling are of an unknown &+Cmetallic &+Lmaterial&+y, the &+Wbrightest white&+y, almost
&+yblindingly stark. The wall &+ypaintings show men and women warriors alike bowing
&+ydown to an &+LEvil King&+y, prisoners of war being put to the sword by him, and
&+ygreat heaps of &+Ygold &+yand weapons under the feet of an &+LEvil King&+y.

&+yA Secret Tunnel~
  &+yThe air is very cold here and layers of &+Cice &+yon the wall. The sounds of metal
&+yon ice echo through the tunnel. Little chunks of dried &+cmeat &+yare spattered
&+ythroughout this room. The walls are covered in gore. Almost as if they were
&+ypainted. There are a few&N skeletons &+yof previous adventurers lie strewn on
&+ythe floor. The walls here are made of very smooth &+Lstone&+y, almost as if it had
&+ybeen eroded away by large amounts of quickly moving &+bwater&+y.

&+LEnd &+yof a Tunnel~
  &+yThe way shrinks away to nothing as the sandy stones of the tunnel close
&+ytogether into a space through which only a snake could fit. There is barely
&+yenough space to turn around and make way back through the crawlway to the north
&+yThis hole must have been used as a lair. There are many &+Wbones &+ystrewn across
&+ythe room. Some human, some indistinguishable. It &+msmells &+yvery bad in here.
&+yThere are many&N souls &+ytrapped behind the walls of this room. Almost as if
&+ytrapped beneath the surface of a frozen lake. Even the floor and ceiling show
&+ythe screaming faces behind them.There is a &+Lstone staircase &+ythat leads downwards
&+yinto deadly part of the graveyard.Legend has it that many a brave adventurer
&+yhas set foot within, but few have ever returned. The &+ctrapdoor &+yseems rather
&+ysmall and looks quite heavy but maybe with some kind of leverage travelers
&+ycould move it.

&+LThe &+mForbidden &+LCatacomb~

&+Rblood &+Land dead, &+gro&+ctt&+ging &+rflesh&+L. Moss covers the walls and ferns even &+Lgrow in
&+Lthe cracks here and there. The air is dank and smells of something dead... or
&+Lmaybe undead. Stone walls, musty air... the earth seems to moan softly.The mind
&+Lwhirls in the hideous madness of this place. The &+cstench &+Lis horrendous and dead
&+Lbodies, sucked of life, lay all over. The floor of this catacomb is littered
&+Lwith the lids of smashed sarcophagi, bits of treasure dropped by thieves and

&+yThe &+LRear Chamber &+yof &+rGuardians &+yStation~
  &+yThis room appears to have once been very ornately furnished, but now
&+yeverything is decayed and moldering. Torch brackets occupy the four corners
&+yof this huge room. Above each torch is a life-like ornate &+Lstone &+ygargoyle.
&+ySuits of armor are spaced along the length of the room. The walls are covered
&+ywith walnut colored &+gwood &+ysiding,and the furniture is of the finest workmanship.
&+yThe floor is made of &+Lblack &+bmarble &+yas is the ceiling. The chamber is well

&+yThe &+cHidden &+yPath of &+LOld &+yGraveyard~
  &+yGraves of recent casualties lie here at the bottom of a rugged mountain. They
&+yappear to have been killed recently, and in a brutal fashion. The old graves are
&+ypartly covered by &+gmoss &+yand a thick &+wmist &+ycarpets the entire area. The
&+ytrees that grow by the road are quite tall considering how you they appear to be.
&+yScattered overa wide area are a few stone heaps, tombs of those who did not last the
&+yperilous journey over the mountain. The dusty path continues towards the hill.

&+yThe &+LForgotten &+yPart of Graveyard on the Hillock~
  &+yOld trees rise tall and green in a distance, circling the mountain side,
&+yforming a soft forest band. The grass grows tall, nearly reaching the waist
&+yof someone of average height and the surrounding oaks and beeches form an
&+yalmost inpenetrable wall around the mountain. Scattered over the area are
&+ygraves similar to those in the graveyard, yet there is a heaviness in the air
&+ynot found elsewhere. The graves have been vandalized and the tombstones smashed
&+yinto rubble. What once used to be an &+Lunholy shrine &+ywhere farmers would
&+ygive thanks for strong harvest and shamans would perform animal sacrifices to
&+ystill the gods has been reduced to a pile of scattered stones. Shimmering in
&+yand out of existence are many misguided dwarven souls who still have not yet
&+yaccepted their death, and seek new bodies to once again reenter the world of
&+ythe living. A large &+rsacrificial &+yaltar has been set in the center of
&+ythe hill.

  &+yThe mine looks long since abandoned by its original creators, possibly driven out
&+yby the hoard of undead creatures that roam the shafts. Several large rocks surround

&+yThe faint light from the fire and the small glow off the shaft walls do very little

&+ya petty little fire that has formed a cloud in the ceiling of this small cavern.
&+yTo the west small tunnel leads a better lit area that smell a brisk fresh and hot

&+yThe air here is very sooty, and it is very hard to breath. The mineshaft leads up
&+yand to the west is beginning the mine tunnel.



  &+yThis room is the lowest part of the mine shaft. The mine looks long since

   &+yThe mine ends abruptly at a jewel-encrusted wall. This small cave has been

&+yThe north section of the small tunnel is covered in a blue light, also
&+yradiating with an aura of heat. The eastern and western walls also glow but
&+ynot as fierce as the southern section. Somehow this place seems very
&+ydifferent from the rest of the mine tunnels, as if something is severely
&+ystrained in the fabric of reality here. To the north the mine continues past
&+ysome small rocks.

&+yThe Four-Way Intersection of the Tunnels~
  &+yThis is a four-way intersection in these mines with directions going east,
&+ywest, north and south which travels backward to the mineshaft itself. A small
&+yglint of the burning torches is all that lights the way here. Spots along
&+ythe jagged wall show that these mines are rich as gold and silver glitters
&+yall around.

   &+yA small glint of the burning torches is all that lights the way here.
&+ySpots along the jagged wall show that these mines are rich as gold and silver
&+yglitters all around. The walls of this mine are chipped and cut to perfection.
&+yWorkmanship of this type could only have been done by the masterful dwarven
&+yrace. Here and there are small rocks and precious jewels that lie scattered
&+yabout. The mine tunnel leads east and west.

&+yThe &+LUnfinished &+yMine~
  &+yThe walls here are jagged and unfinished in there cuts, leaving sharp and
&+yjagged edges at every turn. Small scraps of food and several small disfigured
&+ybodies lie about, no doubt the remains of some unfortunate dwarf. &+rBlood stains
&+yline the walls and entrails are strewn about the floor. This small area would
&+yhave continued east from the main tunnel, but it was left unfinished. A small
&+yglints of metal can be seen within the rocky walls.

&+yThe &+LUnfinished &+yMine Tunnel~
   &+yThis is a small area that has been left unfinished at the moment.The eastern
&+ywall of this mine has been left uncarved and unfinished. The amount of metals
&+yin the walls have decreased slightly here. A small glints of metal can be seen
&+ywithin the rocky walls. Rotting furniture looms obliquely about the room.
&+yThe mine would have continued east from the main tunnel, but it was left
&+yunfinished for some unknow reasson.

&+yThe Mining Equipment Room~
  &+yThis is the storage area for equipment used by the dwarven miners and for
&+ythe raw materials that found down here. The room is very unsturdy as the
&+ysupporting beams are old and rickety. A thick layer of dust implies that not
&+ymany miners actually use the equipment. On the east wall are some inscriptions,
&+yand only the exit leads to the north.

Approaching the &+Lold part&n of the &+yGraveyard&n~
   A small pebble path leads east into a large old graveyard.  The path seems
older than the other paths. and has survived many generations. It leads
deeper into the graveyard into parts where years have passed since a living
soul set foot. Up ahead is a large iron gate, rusted with age. The air is
absolutely still as if the world was holding its breath. Exits lead east
towards the gates and west into the rest of the graveyard.
