&+yA Pass into the Trakkian Foothills&n~
&+y   A narrow though canyon separates the hills to the east here with the
&+ygreat Trakkian Foothills that spread out to the west. Further in the
&+ydistance the Trakkia mountain can be seen rising up higher than all the
&+yother peaks along the range. Trakkia is a ancient and savage place and
&+yexplorers are urged to use caution when attempting to hike around and
&+ytravel the area.

&+LInside the &+YRilla&+L Monestary&n~
&+L   This monestary was bui&+wlt by &+Wmissionaries&+w nearly a hundred years ago,
&+Labove the tomb of a local h&+wero and leader in hopes of drawing the tribe
&+Linto a more 'proper' religion&+w. It is a magnificent struture, both on the
&+Linside and out and has stood th&+we test of time. Inside, every wall is
&+Lcovered by paintings and murals o&+wf &+Ysaints&+w and &+Cangels&+w, and huge decorated
&+Lpillars serve as archways between t&+whe rooms. Though it is small, much
&+Ldetail was put into the building, foc&+wusing on luring the locals in with
&+Lawe and amazement, which, sadly to the &+wresidents of the monestary, has
&+Lthus far failed.

&+yThe Trakkian Foothills&n~
&+y   The Trakkia Foothills stretch out in a vast expanse towards the north-
&+ywest gradually gaining altitude the further one travels. Trakkia is a
&+ybarbaric and ancient land, and the creatures and people who inhabit the
&+yfoothills and mountains are rugged and dangerous, interested very little
&+yin the concerns of the rest of the world. The terrain here is tedious,
&+ymade up of many rolling hills that can be quite steep at times, causing
&+ystrain to the average explorer, though it appears like a walk in the park
&+ycompared to the vast mountain that can be seen in the west.

&+yA Steep Canyon&n~
&+y   This canyon separates the foothills from the mountainside itself with
&+ya gradual incline towards the west. The walls of the canyon are the
&+yjagged cliffs of the summit, rising up as far as the eye can see on
&+yeither direction. The shadow of the mountain casts and eerie darkness
&+yover the area at almost every hour of the day and a sense of foreboding
&+yof trespassing into this ancient land further is nearly overwhelming.

&+yThe Trakkia Mountainside&n~
&+y   The Trakkia Mountainside is a huge cliff-face on the edge of a peak
&+ythat dwarves all the other mountains on the range. The terrain is hard,
&+yrugged, and full of craters and holes that can spell disaster for any
&+yone not prepared for this type of travel. The inhabitants of the moun-
&+ytainside are vicious and predatory, living for centuries as kill-or-
&+ybe-killed and eat-or-be-eaten. Here, in the northwestern edge of the
&+ymountainside a series of &+Lcaves&+y can be seen along the rock face, though
&+yif they are man-made, natural, or burrowed by some creature it is anyones

&+LCatacombs have been here for well over a hundred years, built by the
&+Llocal tribesman to honor their long dead leader who remains buried
&+Lsomewhere down here to this day. Within the recent years visitors to
&+Lthe catacombs and the tomb have been chased away by a sudden influx
&+Lof menacing creatures who have ventured up from the depths of the
&+Lunderdark and legends suggest even the great leader of the trakkian

&+Lwishing to turn back.

&+LInside the &+YRilla&+L Monestary&n~
&+L   This monestary was bui&+wlt by &+Wmissionaries&+w nearly a hundred years ago,
&+Labove the tomb of a local h&+wero and leader in hopes of drawing the tribe
&+Linto a more 'proper' religion&+w. It is a magnificent struture, both on the
&+Linside and out and has stood th&+we test of time. Inside, every wall is
&+Lcovered by paintings and murals o&+wf &+Ysaints&+w and &+Cangels&+w, and huge decorated
&+Lpillars serve as archways between t&+whe rooms. Though it is small, much
&+Ldetail was put into the building, foc&+wusing on luring the locals in with
&+Lawe and amazement, which, sadly to the &+wresidents of the monestary, has
&+Lthus far failed.

&+LA Prison Pit&n~
&+L   It may be barbaric, but this is how the tribesmen of trakkia deal with
&+Ltheir captives and discontents, by throwing them down here, into a filthy
&+Land isolated pit. Like the shaft above the walls have all been sanded
&+Ldown to prevent any chance of climbing back up. The smell here is almost
&+Ldeadly, and its quite apparent the pit has been used as a toilet and
&+Leven worse, a grave for some of its unluckier occupants.

&+LInside the &+YRilla&+L Catacombs&n~
&+L   Its dark, musty, and smells heavily of death and decay. The Rilla
&+LCatacombs have been here for well over a hundred years, built by the
&+Llocal tribesman to honor their long dead leader who remains buried
&+Lsomewhere down here to this day. Within the recent years visitors to
&+Lthe catacombs and the tomb have been chased away by a sudden influx
&+Lof menacing creatures who have ventured up from the depths of the
&+Lunderdark and legends suggest even the great leader of the trakkian
&+Lpeople has been turned into a being of evil and undeath through un-

&+LThe Tomb of Kh&+yan As&+Lpuru&n~
&+L   Here sits the ancient to&+ymb of t&+Lhe trakkian's once great an&+yd noble
&+Lleader Khan Aspuru. At once&+y this r&+Loom was a shining display o&+yf culture
&+Land nobility, with walls, c&+yeiling,&+L and floor all engraved wit&+yh artwork
&+Land decorations to honour t&+yheir fo&+Lunder. Sadly, as time passe&+yd the
&+Ltomb fell into a state of d&+yisrepai&+Lr and decay, and to the ult&+yimate
&+Lhorror of the trakkians liv&+ying abo&+Lve, a great evil overcame t&+yheir great
&+Lhero, turning the once reve&+yred tom&+Lb into a wicked and dangero&+yus place.

&+LThe Lost Vault of Kh&+yan As&+Lpuru&n~
&+L   This is the ancient vault of the late, gre&+yat, Khan Aspuru. Much of
&+Lhis worldly possesions were buried with him at &+ythe time of his demise,
&+Las is the custom in this part of the world, inclu&+yding vast sums of coins
&+Lwhich the locals believe are to pay for the trip to&+y the other side. The
&+Ltreasure lies here to this day, albiet covered in lay&+yers of dust.

&+LThe Tomb of Ki&+yri Iv&+Linof&n~
&+L   This is the tomb of another ancient trakki&+yan king. Like all the
&+Lothers within these dark and foreboding cat&+yacombs the spirit that once
&+Lrested here peacefully has awakened from his &+yenternal sleep angry and
&+Lvehement against the living. Kiri Ivinof's &+ytomb has long been ransacked
&+Lby treasure hunters and graverobbers over the&+y ages, leaving only an
&+Lancient casket and one very resentful spirit.
