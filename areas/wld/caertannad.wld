&+LDown a &+cSteel&+L Ladder~
&+L   Moored to the granite, this &+Wsteel&+L ladder steadily scales the wall.  Its
&+Lround rungs are mounted into two flat strips of steel that make up the sides
&+Lof the ladder.  Occasionally, one of the rungs spins in its place, making
&+Lthis a potentially dangerous climb.  Around you the sounds of dripping &+Bwater
&+Land the eerie chittering of noctural animals makes you want to be off the
&+Lladder all the sooner.  Despite the comfort of knowing that this dismal place
&+Lkeeps most people safe at night, you can't shake the feeling that perhaps its
&+Lnot as safe in here as it is out there.&n

&+RThe Parapets of &+LCaer Tannad&N~
&+R   The guard's walkway is flanked by by two low walls, four foot stones spaced
&+Rout so that an archer can fire then pull back safely to reload.  The floor is
&+Rcomposed of tightly fitted &+ysarsen&+R cobblestones, lain upon the granite that
&+Rmakes up most of the keep.  The air up here is cool and slightly faster than
&+Ron the ground, with the vague smell of salt water brought up from the harbor
&+Rto the west.  You can see most of the province from this height, the wilds to
&+Rthe north and south, &+BTimeless Sea&+R to the west, and the small rooftops that
&+Rare the whole of &+WTharnadia&+R down to the east.  Overhead a stone bridge spans
&+Rgap between the two keeps, connecting their third floors from between the

&+LAn &+yAncient&+L Wizard's Tower of C&+Yo&Nn&+Lj&+Yu&nr&+La&+Yt&Ni&+Lon~
&+c   This sizable spire appears to be the study of a very powerful conjurer, as
&+creagent bottles and spell components lie everywhere.  Several shelves line the
&+cwalls, holding these components and a number of ancient-looking texts.  At the
&+ceastern end of the room sits a large desk made from solid &+Rfire&+c, which seems to
&+cpulse with the images of strange netherworld creatures.  Behind the desk sits
&+ca huge high-backed chair that looks extremely old and very comfortable.  The
&+cmost fascinating feature about this study is the &+Mportal&+c set into the western
&+cwall.  Shaped into a delicate oval, the portal appears to be a gate to another
&+clocation within the keep, as another mage's study can be seen on the other
&+cside.  Energy seems to radiate from the portal, which is obviously used as a
&+cmethod of fast transit and communication.  A granite stairway spirals downward
&+cthrough the floor.&n

portal~
   The portal shimmers with magical energy as you inspect it.  All around its
edges, you see tiny swirls of color dance along the edge and sometimes even
crackle, reiterating that this portal was created with powerful magic.  It
looks as though you could just enter the portal and step right through to the
other side.

desk chair~
   This desk is formed of tangible fire, the strange flames niether burn the

~
E
text texts~
   The texts are all bound in black leather with electric blue trimmings, and
glow with a soft blue aura.  When you try and grab for one, something gently
pushes your hand away.  No matter how you try and move it, some unseen force
prevents your efforts from succeeding.

&+WA Freezing &+CPortal &+WAtop the Tower of Sorcery&N~
&+m   Elevated nearly four hundred feet from the the mesa top, the several small
&+Cwindows&+m here offer a fantastic view of the city down to the east.  Rows of
&+marcane magical texts in &+yoaken&+m bookshelves line every wall in this place of
&+mhigh magic, obviously used by mages studying the art.  There is a huge desk
&+mnear one wall, with a high backed chair behind it.  Illuminated by the glow
&+mof many small orbs, this room radiates magical energy, as if a gate into the
&+mvery skein of magic itself, lay somewhere close by.  Against the east wall
&+mstands another kind of &+Mportal&+m, an ovular gate to place elsewhere in the keep.
&+mIt stands about seven feet high and resembles a mirror in many respects,
&+mexcept for the fact that another mage's study can be seen on the other side.
&+mColors that span the entire spectrum dance all along the edges of the portal.
&+mA &+Ylightning&+m baustrade leads downwards from here into the lower levels of the

touch them.

&+LAn &+yAncient &+LBedchamber&N~
&+w   This oppulent chamber belongs to the Queen of &+WTharnadia&+w, with its
&+wrefined aires and petite decour.  A large canopy bed, stuffed with swan
&+wfeathers, dominates the center of the room.  It has white brocaded silk
&+wdraperies, which dangle down from the canopy-rails, and is covered in
&+wexquisite animal furs.  Opening up to a view of the sea, a large bay
&+Cwindow&+w stands framed in the wall beyond the bed.  The furniture in this

&+LA Corridor Littered With Debris&N~
&+w   Smooth granite walls stretch themselves upward nearly two-hundred and forty
&+wfeet, where they meet with the &+Bturquoise&+w ceiling that bridges them.  Lush and
&+wvibrant, a &+rcrimson&+w rug leads down the hallway's center, leaving a one foot
&+wmargin of polished marble on each side.  Various scents float heavily upon the
&+wair, in an attempt to combat the smell of mildew that accompanies structures
&+wthis large.  Rare &+Ltapestries&+w hang, almost haphazardly, throughout the halls.
&+wImported long ago, these wall-rugs are the remnants of a long forgotten race
&+wthat once thrived far to the east.  The hallway continues to the north and to

&+Lnumber of years ago.  Huge pillar-like protrusions of blackrock jut out
&+Lall around a simple clearing of black dust and dirt.  Drawn onto the
&+Lground rather recently is a strange chalk pattern, in which the center
&+Lof the rift rests.  A rocky trail winds northwards here and down this

&+WThe Beginning of a Trail up Mount Straka&N~
   &+WThis trail traverses the great Mountain Straka , situated in the southern
&+Wside of the Alteran Valley.  The frost winter winds have blown numerous
&+Wblizzards through this area, blanketting the entire valley with a thick
&+Wlayer of fluffy white snow.  Numerous trees, completely devoid of all
&+Wleaves, line the mountain as well as the rocky trails through this
&+Wtowering snow-covered rock.

&+LA Large Cave Opening&N~
   &+LThis large opening births passage through a cave within the
&+Lsnowy heart of the Alteran Valley.  Although dark, there appears
&+Lto be more to this cave than this one single cavern, as a tunnel
&+Lbranches off along the southeastern cavern wall.

   &+LThe tunnel to the north leads into this cave, which is covered in
&+La breathtaking sheen of crystal ice.  The frozen winds from outside
&+Lkiss these cavern walls just enough to glaze these Alteran rock walls
&+Lwith a light and dazzling layer of ice.

&+LA Small Cave&N~
   &+LA small cave, a simplet inlet in these mountains of the Shaeradin Valley.
&+LThis cave seems to have been used as a campsite more then once, as there are
&+Lnumerous scorch-marks on the ground suggesting campfires on multiple
&+Loccasions.  This cave is relatively small with a very close rear wall,
&+Lmaking it very shallow-feeling.  It does an adequate job, however, serving
&+Las shelter.

&+Wlike frozen fingerbones.  The harsh winter winds of the Alteran
&+Wvalley blow with an imposing strength and chill.
