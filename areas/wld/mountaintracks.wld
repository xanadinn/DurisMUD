An Abandoned &+gWaystation&n~
   It seems as if there was once a way station here. It was probably constructed
as early warning and defense against some of the undead who dwell on the other
side of the mountain. It stands well over one hundred feet tall and sits on top
of the mountainside, allowing a great view of the surrounding lands. Anyone
looking could easily spot something moving from great distances. Raid parties
are more easily discernable. This tower must have served a vital role for the
the early defense of some of the less protected settlements of the land.
The treacherous mountains prevent anyone from entering the lands to the north,
leaving this the sole route. Dark skies above signal rain and thunder can be
heard in the distance. A small wind creates an eerie sound.

A Small &+gTrail &nThrough the &+yMountains~
   This is a very small trail used by game. There are other smaller trails that
break off and run into foliage and into deeper darker places unseen. The prints
from the game are dry and imprinted. When it rains the trail is almost washed
clean of all prints and becomes mush. The plants that these game feed off of
are few because it looks as if a large majority of the green that grows on this
trail and perhaps all of the forest is poisonous. Any number of poisonous
plants litter the trail. A small breeze stirs the restless branches and leaves
that cover the ground, and a strange odor can be smelled. From this vantage
point nothing can be seen of the surrounding mountainside, however, from a
higher vantage point one can see the magnificence of the impervious mountain
and the thick forests that are within.

Before a &+yGigantic &+LHole&n in the &+yMountain~
   It seems as if this section of earth was once a &+rbattlefield&n of great
magnitude. Only magic could have devastated this section of earth. It seems as
if the mountain itself was blasted by a great force of unbelievable power. The
stretch of land that is missing could cover the same area as the great cities
themselves there can be no doubt that this was once the site of a great
battle of such intensity that it carved out its place in the mountain. It has,
however, been years upon years since this battle occurred because the plant
life and animal life alike has begun the gradual habitation of the land so
there are small trees growing large amounts of green covering the land. From
this vantage point the mountain range is visible. It's a small wonder these
mountains are rumored to be impassible, because they go on endlessly.

Before a &+LDark &+yCave~
   Above, where the mountain should be, is only an ashen earth. It rises and
slopes as if it were once a mountain and continues skywards for hundreds upon
hundreds of feet. However, it seems as if it were blasted away centuries ago
by a magical force never before seen. The magnitude of the explosion took out
half the mountain and the surrounding countryside. From this vantage point the
full force of the explosion can be seen. It is impossible to imagine anything
ever surviving something such as this. The fallout must have reached great
distances. It looks as if a hand of some powerful immortal reached out and
grabbed a fistful of the mountain. It slopes at an odd angle and covers great
distances. The ash that is layered upon the new growth of foliage and trees
is still visible, signaling that this even must have happening sometime in
recent history. Above and beyond the mountain continues onward. A strange
cave is visible. It is dark and layered with foliage but is visible.

A &+LBattlescarred &nSection of the &+yMountain~
   There are large amounts of ash that cover the ground. It seems as if this
area of the mountain was once a battlefield of great magnitude. The powerful
magic must have blasted away this chunk of the mountain into oblivion. It is
difficult to imagine such a force, however, it happened long ago. Already,
there are plants and animals beginning to return to this habitat. Green plants
cover the once ashen barren land and the game once again have made this once
barren section of earth their home again. There are no sizable trees as there
once were, however, there are smaller baby trees rising a good twenty feet
into the air. Smaller, no doubt, than their ancient cousins, but no less
lively. The smell of ash still lingers in the air and will remain so for
quite some time. The huge chunk of the mountain that was blasted away looks
weathered and shaky, as if ready to fall once pushed.

   This tunnel seems endless. It runs a great distance to the east and is
very treacherous. There are any number of loose stalactites hanging from the
tunnel above, which encloses and tightens an already small tunnel. Sounds echo

run into a cavern of some sort somewhere down the way, however, it is doesn't
seem as if anything has ever ventured here. Maybe the blast on the side of the
mountain opened up the earth, granting access to this mountain's inner sides.

Under a &+cSilver Spring~
   The Silver Spring is fresh water that runs through the under mountain. Its
current isn't strong enough to take one under or rush one along with it. The
taste of the water is something special, unlike anything. Its tastes so fresh
and must be a godsend from some immortal. Vision is clear, clear as day under
the water. There are some plant life and small underwater life as well. The
rocks below seem to sparkle when light reflects off. There must be a ton of
healthy minerals in this spring. There seems to be no end to the spring, it
does, however, seem to run under the mountain itself. It is impossible to
surmise where it ends. Perhaps it runs a great distance, perhaps not.

Before a &+yWooden Fence&n~
   A small fence runs west and east. It isn't very tall and one could just
jump over it. It is very old and looks ready to fall over if pushed. It is
made of wood and sags a great deal in some places. The woodlands seem to be
coming to an end abruptly passed the fence some ten or twenty yards to the
north. There is no gate to this fence, well, none visible at least. There is a
small section of the fence that has been overturned somehow, probably the
wind. The tall trees make everything dark and foreboding and the wind creates
an eerie sound. This forest is forlorn it seems, with nothing in it but wild
animals and weeds. Sounds of farm animals can be made out to the north, so
there must be some sort of settlement near bye. The weeds cover the fence.

    This is a twisted path through a forest. There are a great many obstacles
to overcome if you wish to pass through it. The treacherous paths are cluttered
with dead animals that stink. The ground is covered in leaves. During the
winter when the snow falls it is impossible to walk through this forest without
breaking an ankle because the snow hides the landscape. There are too many
trenches and twisted turns. The trees above hide the sun when it comes out
during the day, making the ground soggy and leaves slippery. This mountain is
sometime the recipient of monsoons, which lasts for days and sometimes weeks.
The peaks of the great mountain is barely visible through the tree limbs and
branches. There are rumors of great evil within this forest, adventurers are
said to enter never to return. The wind blows softly, sending leaves tumbling.

An Enormous&+y Under mountain &+mCavern~
   Sounds echo easily enough in this enormous cavern. It must have been hidden
away for centuries until a blast took half of the mountainside away, granting
access to the tunnels underneath. This underworld cavern seems like another
world. There are all sorts of plant life and small fungi here. Not only are
they here, but they seem to be prospering. The air is cleaner here, the
freshness of it startling. Perhaps there is some secret to these caverns
that are waiting to be discovered. It is an incredible sight to behold, and
with the number of fresh water fish living within the springs that seem to go
on endlessly, one could live here indefinitely and find food, warmth, and
shelter. This cavern is a precious treasure and could be fought over, if anyone
realized it even existed.

Over an &+yUnder Mountain &+cWaterfall~
   The silver spring comes to an end here. It runs over a cliff under the
mountain. The waterfall falls several hundred feet down and falls upon soft
water. It is uncertain how deep the water is however. It could be a treacherous
fall or it could just hurt a little. If there are shaped edged rocks down
there or if the water runs shallow, then the fall will be fatal. The air is
dark and a little chilly here. The shaft that the water flows down is very
wide. It would be impossible to climb back up the shaft, however, maybe by
magical means one could just float right to the top. The deafening roar or the
waterfall disorientates the senses. A small mist rises from below, there must
something warming the water, perhaps some lava tubes of some sort.

shaft is very wide and it is unlikely that anyone would hit them falling.
Ascending the shaft would be dangerous and impossible. It would take magical
means to ascend here. Falling is an absolution without it. It is unclear
where these falls could lead, perhaps to the underworld and further to the
under dark.

At the Base of an &+yUnder Mountain &+cWaterfall~
   This is where the flowing spring that flows through the under mountain caverns
ends. It rushes over the cliff above and falls several hundred feet to this
base. Anyone caught in the springs would have been caught up in its current
and swept away, meaning they would end up here. Falling hundreds of feet is
fatal, however, the soft water here spells the difference between life and
death. Landing on rocks or a hard basin is death, landing on this soft fresh
water bone breaking, but not fatal. There is a mist that rises here, and the
water is surprisingly warm. Something is warming the water causing the mist,
perhaps there are some lava tubes beneath this fresh water base. The shaft
rises well over three hundred feet high and can not be scaled to the top. Only
through magical means can the top be reached.

A &+LNiche &nin the &+LWild Under dark~
   In the under mountain there can be any number of dangers, anything from
falling rocks to slippery footing to jagged slopes and everything in-between.
What cannot be accounted for and prepared for are the many dangerous other
beings that seek refuge within the wild under dark present. It is impossible
to determine how many dark dwellers live within the under mountain, because it
seems as if it is becoming the dark under dark the evil dwellers reside in.
There could be untold hordes living under this mountain, hiding it out,
preparing for whatever comes. This niche in the wild tunnels of this mountain
is similar to those of the wild under dark. It could be refuge for those who
do not wish to be found. It is dark, damp, and a dangerous place to be if
you're not wishing for confrontation because it is sure to ensue.

   Years ago this tube must have run full of lava. Now this tube is nothing
more than a shaft that runs the distance of the under mountain. It is uncertain
just how far this tube stretches, however, it is a good bet that it runs
the distance of the mountain and even further. The lava hasn't run here in
quite sometime. The dried lava looks peculiar, as if molded. It is unremarkable
but looks funny. There can be no way of telling if anyone has traversed these
tubes. There are only two ways to travel from this point on, to the north and
to the east. Both tubes look similar, however, the east one looks a little
cramped. The smell of sulfur lingers in the air, since there is no way to
ventilate the tunnels it will remain here for quite some time.

A &+yRocky Path~
   There are a number of trees here. Despite the trees rising hundreds of feet
into the air, the mountain peaks are visible. This mountain range envelopes
this forest and surrounds it on all sides. It is rumored that these dangerous
rocky mountain slopes are impassible. At the top of the mountain peaks are
plateaus of ice, and dry cold air. With such high altitudes the temperature
drops and the air thins, not much could live there. There is rumored to be
some sort of barbarian encampment there. No expedition has ever been sent to
find or dislodge these icy mountain nomads, however, none is needed. They are
rarely spoken of, let alone seen. They are undoubtedly hostile to all
outsiders. There are a number of rocks here, large and small. Beasts are sure
to roam in this part of the mountain range, dangerous beasts looking to
protect there territory. A small rock slides down a slope.

Before a &+LStatue &nto the &+LForger Astansus~
   Within these dormant lava-tubes is a statue dedicated to the great forger
Astansus. There is no telling who created this statue. It is carved out of
obsidian and must have been done on the spot. Maybe the duergar dwarves
carved it, however, they are not known to do such things. Perhaps it was made
by some fallen immortal in respect for the great immortal. There can be little
to surmise about the statue except that it was crafted by someone of great
power and influence. It would take a momentous effort to create such a
masterful piece again. Whomever carved it, must have done so in secret in this
wild under mountain, for it is even unheard of even today above ground. The
statue must weigh several tons and is flawless.

A Small &+gTrail &nThrough the &+yMountains~
   This is a very small trail used by game. There are other smaller trails that
break off and run into foliage and into deeper darker places unseen. The prints
from the game are dry and imprinted. When it rains the trail is almost washed
clean of all prints and becomes mush. The plants that these game feed off of
are few because it looks as if a large majority of the green that grows on this
trail and perhaps all of the forest is poisonous. Any number of poisonous
plants litter the trail. A small breeze stirs the restless branches and leaves
that cover the ground, and a strange odor can be smelled. From this vantage
point nothing can be seen of the surrounding mountainside, however, from a
higher vantage point one can see the magnificence of the impervious mountain
and the thick forests that are within.

On a &+gPlain~
   Rolling foothills continue in most directions. The plain's tall grass makes
traveling through it difficult. Anything could be hiding within these fields,
rodents for sure, little smaller nastier things as well. When the wind blows,
the tall grass is blown side to side. It is a relaxing to watch the tall plain
grass sway in the wind while listening to the trees in the distance sway as
well. There could be many things in the forest that are nasty, but from here
it doesn't seem too ominous. A tall mountain range looms in the distance,
and it spans across the horizon. Dark clouds hang over the mountain and
there are rumors of unfortold marauders and evil monsters there as well. These
mountains looks treacherous, they give off a cold aura of pain and death.
Perhaps the mountain range is cursed. There is a slight chill in the air.

A &+gTurning~
   The forest trail comes to a turning here as it suddenly turns into a former
village. The ruined village is now charred and left to ruins by those who
once lived here. There is a small sign poking out of the foliage that isn't
legible. It would seem that this was some sort of encampment of loggers of
some sort. No one has lived here for several years however and it is unclear
of which race did. There are numerous abandoned and forsaken cabins that once
stood here, however, they are now nothing but ruined timber that can barely
be made out. There hasn't been anything living in here for centuries it seems.
The trail turns sharply to the left and the foliage thickens. It is unclear
how deep the mountains go on continue because the trees block most of the view.

An &+LDank Laboratory&n~
   There are animal skins hanging all around the laboratory. All different
types. They stink terribly, making it difficult to breathe. Furs lined with
dried blood are sewn together to form different articles of clothing. There
is no comfort in wearing anything like that, it's hard to imagine anyone ever
wanting to wear something like that, but its here. There are different
concoctions littered around the room, some spilt and some still in there
containers. Some of these potions are acidic and burn through rock. There
are different totems hanging on the walls. Totems of brass, totems of bone,
totems of all different kinds. There is power in totems, they are used by
the shamans of the world to cast their magic, with each totem representing
a different class of magic. It is very dark in here.

A Small &+yVillage Trail~
   This small village trail leads directly into the village that once stood
here. It was once a logger village but now is abandoned. The plant has come
alive and overtaken much of the village and the forest has taken up residence
here were the loggers once did. The timber has rotted and decayed away and
is barely discernable from the foliage. There was once life in this village,
now there is not. It was not a large one, however, it consisted of a number
of small buildings and a couple of larger ones. It is impossible to discern
the nature of these buildings, because they are in now a crumbled heap. The
trail is covered in foliage and some refuse. This village once thrived, and for
reasons unknown, it was abandoned and now is dead.

Before a Large &+LCemetery&n~
   This large cemetery is were the remains of a great many loggers lay. The
headstones are the only thing marking this place as a cemetery because the
foliage and forest have taken over this once peaceful place. Who's remains
lay where is impossible to determine because the headstones are legible no
longer. There are a great many headstones, giving the impression that this
village has been around for a great number of years. It stretches off in the
distance and is surrounded by a layer of darkness because the trees are thick
and they block out the sun. There aren't any trails here from game, they must
have a sense to stay away from this place. An occasional branch stirs as a
chipmunk or some tree dweller scrambles up a branch.

The &+LTomb &nof the &+rVillage Elder~
   This is the grave of the village elder who resided over the village. Perhaps
he got the worst of the curse that was laid upon this place for residing and
leading his people to doom, one can only surmise. His face is contorted as if
he died in agony. His people must have buried him with little regard if he is
the one, in fact, responsible for leading his village into a curse blindly.
There are strands of gray hair on his person and he was dressed in a suitable
garb in the day, but now is completely gross and smells of death. There is
something odd about this tomb, something just doesn't seem right. The air stirs
as if something unforeseen awaits to be awoken. It is very dark here.

are villages set up around a trade, and this being a logging camp meant that
they were very successful. There are a great number of headstones in this

they seem to weep a serenation of death. It is very dark.

Thick within the &+yBrush~
   There are so many plants and weeds here that it is nearly impossible to
move without chopping a way through. Vines dangle from trees and the brush
entangles the feet. Tree limbs brush against the face and scratch the flesh.
The overshadowing evergreen trees don't allow any sunlight to enter this
place, it is very dark. Rocks the size of tree trunks lay here and there,
covered with moss and embedded into the ground. Taking into account the
impassible nature of this forest on the mountainside, its safe to say
traversing its great length will be arduous. Rumors spread that this mountain
is has a world of its own, with many living creatures unheard of and small
cities in it center. Powerful magi are said to have built power pieces of
magic within the shelter of the mountainside. Rumors spread that this land
was a battlefield from long ago, with immense power being unleashed here.

A &+LSecret Laboratory&n~
   This is a secret laboratory of some powerful alchemist. A large table rests
in the center of the room with many different things on it. Swirling potions,
containers of different sizes and shapes, charts, graphs, notebooks, and a
variety of gadgets to gauge different things are on the table. The table is
made of a great oak, and has many stains on it. Some parts of the table seem
to have been eaten through by some sort of acid and others burnt to ash.
Around the table are other countertops with lesser amounts of items on them,
however, none of them are less important. There is a small bed in the corner
of the cave, it is used regularly. This is a nice hideaway to prepare potions
in solitude and in secret. It is very dark, and it smells terribly.

pints. Halflings and humans mingle here to the sound of music and enjoy the
good ale. The tinkers are known to party with the best of them, and halflings
are said to enjoy a fine celebration as well as the next race. There are a
few hookers here as well, they are servicing many of the tinkers under the
covers. The sexy young women seem to be having a good time as well, as they
drink heavily and are touched. Half naked men moan with pleasure as they
indulge themselves to the finest feeling in the world, a good woman. The pipe
is also circulated here, halfling weed is legendary. The ring of caravans
has been arranged to provide ample privacy and security for the tinkers while
they celebrate. Who knows what lurks in the surrounding forest and countryside.

An &+yOld Forgotten &+gFarm~
   Its been years since this farm has been anything but what it is now. Weeds
and dirt cover long forgotten tools on the ground. Hoes, racks, shovels,
wheels and wagons now sit uselessly. Where once fertile fields were now is
nothing but a forgotten land. There is a farmhouse in the distance, passed
these fields, which look to have been plowed a long time ago. The farm
house seems to have stood there for years. Its a good distance to the north.
There's another tool shack far to the west in-between two large boulders, it
looks ready to fall over. At one time, this was a busy farm, now its ruins.
The smell of weed can be smelt. There must be some pipe burning where near by,
perhaps to the north where that farm house and shack are. The ground is muck.

   This is a plowed field. There isn't much to be seen here except what remains
of a fertile farm. Weeds now cover the entire field. This was once a productive
farm, now it lays in ruins and is long forgotten. It extends north east and
west quite a ways. Beyond these plowed fields beyond the trees the mountainside
is visible. It is capped with ice and snow. A building lies to northward, it
was once a farmhouse where the farmers lived. Just to the side of it lies the
remnants of a barn. A large shack of lies off to the west, it is ready to
fall over. The farm is surrounded on all sides by a forest. The wind picks up,
sending leaves tumbling down the field. There is an icy chill to the air.

they were very successful. There are a great number of headstones in this
cemetery, meaning that it has been around a long time. Who's remains lay where
is not possible to determine since a majority of the stones have been cracked,
overturned, and lay in a crumbled heap. The air if very damp and the trees seem
to recognize this place for what it is, a cemetery. It is a solemn place and
they seem to weep a serenation of death. It is very dark.

The &+LForgotten Catacombs~
   It seems as if these catacombs were lost in the centuries that pursued its
construction. No one knew about this place when the logging village above
was built. It was rumored that a great civilization ruled over these lands
long ago and was lost somehow, perhaps this is what remains of that society.
A curse was laid upon the village above, perhaps the same curse that destroyed
all of those who lay within these walls. The odor of death and decay fills
the air and the stench that the closed cause are nearly poisonous. Staying in
these catacombs would not be advisable. There are endless amounts of tombs
here, however, disturbing them is not an option because it would take an army
of workers years to open one, let alone them all. They are all sealed securely
with techniques lost down through the ages. What race lays within is impossible
to determine. The air is filled with moisture making it difficult to breath.

&+LJunction of &+RLava &+rTubes&N~
   Years ago this area must been flooded with lava that burst from the
heart of the mountain. The smell of sulfur still lingers in the air but
life seems to have reestablished itself in this otherwise barren mountain.
To the north stretches a small forest that runs on both sides of a small
mountain trail. The pine trees grow thick and the woods seem alive with
activity. It is almost as if this part was untouched by the apocalypse of
old. Perhaps this canyon was deep enough to escape the destruction.

A &+LCollapsed Tunnel&n~
   There's nothing that stands out in this tunnel, because it is very dark.
Not many things live deep within these catacombs. It is dark, dirty, and
difficult to cope with. Every sound echoes easily within these corridors through
the ground. Water drips in the distance, it fills the cavern. The tombs here
are covered partially with rubble, the tunnel has collapsed. There is no way
passed this collapsed section of earth, there is nothing much of importance to
see. The tombs are marked with the names of the deceased that they now encase.
Women, children, and men are all buried together here. None of them rich or
not worthy enough to search for treasures or anything of value. Some of the
richer sections of these catacombs lay the tombs of the rich, finding them
would be glorious. The darkness in this tunnel is frightening.

A Lair of an &+GENORMOUS&n &+gGreen Dragon~
   There are piles and piles of bones of so many different creatures. Human
bones mingle with elven bones, which both stand apart from the minotaur. Their
armor all but ruined from the gaseous breath of the dragon. They are piled on
top of each other in the center of the chamber, as if counted. Green scales fill
this enormous chamber, fallen from the great beast. The cavern rises hundred
and hundreds of feet into the air and splits in many directions. It is hard
to say how long this chamber has been here, however, it must have been a very
long time. Perhaps some sort of curse has been laid upon this place, or the
dragon that dwells here. It is difficult to grasp the power of the gods, for
they are all powerful. Grasping the reality that we are mortal do we begin to
understand the power exhausted to chain a fierce beast such as a dragon up
for all this time. One thing for certain, appearances here result in death.

A Small &+yVillage Trail~
   This small village trail leads directly into the village that once stood
here. It was once a logger village but now is abandoned. The plant has come
alive and overtaken much of the village and the forest have taken up residence
here were the loggers once did. The timber has rotted and decayed away and
is barely discernable from the foliage. There was once life in this village,
now there is not. It was not a large one, however, it consisted of a number
of small buildings and a couple of larger ones. It is impossible to discern
the nature of these buildings, because they are in now a crumbled heap. The
trail is covered in foliage and some refuse. This village once thrived, and for
reasons unknown, it was abandoned and now is dead.

Thick within the &+gForest Foliage~
   The forest comes alive and swallows up any trail that might have been here.
There once was a village to the south of here and a trail leading to it, the
trail has been since swallowed by the forest and the village looks to have
succumbed to something much worse. The timber used to construct the cabins has
all been consumed by the forest and are no longer standing, in fact, they are
barely recognizable for what they are. The years must have flowed by, centuries
perhaps. The forest has swallowed the entire village and the gate leading to
it, which is made of iron and is no longer standing. There must have been some
sort of curse laid upon this village. The trees rise well over twenty feet and
nearly block out the surrounding mountainside, however, this is deep within
the mountain ranges without a doubt. The air stirs restlessly.

   This is a very small trail used by game. There are other smaller trails that
break off and run into foliage and into deeper darker places unseen. The prints
from the game are dry and imprinted. When it rains the trail is almost washed
clean of all prints and becomes mush. The plants that these game feed off of
are few because it looks as if a large majority of the green that grows on this
trail and perhaps all of the forest is poisonous. Any number of poisonous
plants litter the trail. A small breeze stirs the restless branches and leaves
that cover the ground, and a strange odor can be smelled. From this vantage
point nothing can be seen of the surrounding mountainside, however, from a
higher vantage point one can see the magnificence of the impervious mountain
and the thick forests that are within.

Inside an &+yAbandonned Watchtower~
   This tower was abandoned long ago. It was constructed masterfully for its
day and must be centuries old. It's old now and doesn't look entirely stable,
yet it still stands. The old timber moans when the wind blows and the entire
tower shifts, a bad sign. There is an odor in the air and it stinks, perhaps
caused by the mildew and animal plant life that now inhabit this place. This
tower was once used everyday all day long to watch for peril. Perhaps there
is a village or something close by, which would explain the need for one. It
rises well over two hundred feet and could spot things from great distances.
There are scattered remains of armor and weaponry laying around, however, most
of it looks too old and completely useless.

Before Large &+LRavine~
   A huge ravine spans the across the mountain range. The ravine is very deep
and runs a good distance across. It would take a great deal of time to hike
across to the other side. There is any number of obstacles within the ravine,
a small running stream, prickly vines and brush, jagged edged rocks, nasty
animals, poisonous plants, and a great many things unseen. When it rains here
in the mountains, the small stream becomes a small river, running through the
ranges and out to some larger water source unseen. Eagles can be seen circling
overhead, protecting their nests. The sky is dark with thunderclouds. Storms
have a way of flooding this ravine with water, anything caught in a large
shower will be washed away. An small breeze stirs, bringing the scent of rain.

A &+LRavine~
   This ravine was created long ago with the forging of the mountain. The gods
played a terrible trick on the mortals with the forging of these mountains. It
is said that long ago that there was a beautiful race of creatures inhabiting
the northern side of the continent, and that in their vanity created their own
oblivion in which they remain for all eternity. The gods forged these
mountains, centuries ago before all this happened. It seems as if they had a
sense that the beautiful creatures to the north were destined to succumb to
hubris. With the creation of these mountains, traveling between the two sides
of this massive continent is nearly impossible. With this ravine, traveling
through these mountains to reach the other side is next to impossible. It would
be quite an accomplishment if it were done. Bones litter the ravine's rocks.

Before a &+yRocky Ascent&n~
   There are a great many jagged rocks inhibiting travel in this so called
trail to ascend the mountain slope. The trail continues to rise a good distance
and goes on for quiet some distance. Trailing these treacherous mountain
cliffs unprepared can only result in death or injury. Only experienced mountain
climbers should even attempt to climb the total ascent of the mountain,
however, this trail doesn't seem overly treacherous, but not for the unwary
or unprepared. It runs a quite a distance in to the north where a few larger
ascents are visible, ascents requiring rope or any other means to scale. There
are a few nests visible along the cliffs, they belong to the bird wild life.
A small breeze picks up, sending small pebbles through the air.

A &+yRocky Mountain Path~
   This mountain path is rarely used, if it ever was. There is no evidence that
it is used frequently by anything other than wild animals. The number of
wild beasts that live amongst the mountains are few in number, however, they
are very dangerous. Anything from bobcats to wild snakes live in this sort of
habitat. There is an occasional presence along the trail of these creatures,
they mostly stay hidden and are rarely seen by humanoids. These animals have
a sixth sense and can sense an intruder or another presence in their domain.
Small boulders and jagged edged rocks lay here and there inhibiting any sort
of traveling, preventing carriages and even horses from having an easy time.
Nothing frequents these parts of the mountainside much. Dark clouds hang down
from the sky. Storms are frequent and unavoidable here, shelter is a must.

wild beasts that live amongst the mountains are few in number, however, they
are very dangerous. Anything from bobcats to wild snakes live in this sort of
habitat. There is an occasional presence along the trail of these creatures,
they mostly stay hidden and are rarely seen by humanoids. These animals have
a sixth sense and can sense an intruder or another presence in their domain.
Small boulders and jagged edged rocks lay here and there inhibiting any sort
of traveling, preventing carriages and even horses from having an easy time.
Nothing frequents these parts of the mountainside much. Dark clouds hang down
from the sky. Storms are frequent and unavoidable here, shelter is a must.

Before a &+yRope Bridge&n~
   This rope bridge was constructed a long time ago. Crossing must be done with
care, because there is no evidence to support that this bridge was constructed
well. There are three ropes running the span of the deep mountain slope. One on
either side of each other while one below and centered between the other two.
This allows one person the privilege of crossing at a time since it is obvious
that it can't support much else. The rope are tied onto larger boulders on
each side. Fifty feet is a long ways to cross on a bridge such as this,
however, there isn't any other apparent way to get to the other side. Even small
breezes can spell doom while someone was on the bridge, causing it to rock
and sway back and forth, making the unfortunate soul lose balance and sending
it to its death some hundreds of feet below. Small bones lay on those rocks.

On a &+yRope Bridge&n~
   Some donkey brains are scattered along the ravine's bottom. There is no
way anything larger than a donkey or a horse can traverse this narrow rope
bridge, the writing is on the wall so to speak, as there are so many bones
littering the rocks below. It must be a four hundred foot drop to the bottom.
It would be best to find another route to travel if to advert a catastrophe.
A great view of the mountain is visible from this vantage point. It continues
in all directions and must be noticeable from afar. It is said at the center
of this great mountain range there is an active volcano. Storm clouds race
overhead, as if pushed by some force, ominous. The rope sways in the wind.

Along the &+yMountain Peaks~
   There can be no doubt that a fall from this altitude would result in death.
There is no place to land that would be gentle, there are just too many rocks
and even more dangerous niches in this mountain that would spell doom. From
this altitude much is visible of the surrounding landscape. The mountain is
densely populated with forest. The cliffs and mountain range far to either side
eastward and westward are covered with snow and ice at their peaks because
they rise even higher than here. There is some sort of settlement far to the
west of here, it stretches for some distance and seems to be heavily populated.
The night sky here can be lonely and cold, being exposed to the elements for
even one night could be no less than troublesome. Animals rustle the brush.

A Small &+yVillage Trail~
   This small village trail leads directly into the village that once stood
here. It was once a logger village but now is abandoned. The plant has come
alive and overtaken much of the village and the forest has taken up residence
here were the loggers once did. The timber has rotted and decayed away and
is barely discernable from the foliage. There was once life in this village,
now there is not. It was not a large one, however, it consisted of a number
of small buildings and a couple of larger ones. It is impossible to discern
the nature of these buildings, because they are in now a crumbled heap. The
trail is covered in foliage and some refuse. This village once thrived, and for
reasons unknown, it was abandoned and now is dead.

An &+yAbandonned Cottage&n~
   This cottage has been abandoned for what looks like a century. It seems
as if the roof is collapsing and it doesn't look at all stable, almost as if
a slight breeze could cause it to cave in. There doesn't seem to be any
evidence that this cottage has been used for anything by anyone or nearly
anything, aside form the plants and animals that have overtaken it. It stinks
inside here, as there is nothing to circulate the foul air out and allow
clean air in. This must have been a cottage for one of the logging families
that lived in this village, however, like everything else in this village, it
has long since been abandoned and lays now in ruins. The floor is ready to
fall in, the walls look terrible, it would be best not to stay here long.

A Former &+yVillage Factory&n~
   This was once a factory designated to process the wood that the lumberjacks
brought in. It hasn't been used for centuries, however, it still stands, unlike
the majority of the village. There is a variety of equipment used to process
all the lumber, everything from saws to platforms and trollies and carts.
The amount of space in this factory is unbelievable, it must have been a highly
populated village able to bring in large quantities of goods. It must have
provided the everything the people needed to thrive and continue on with day
to day life out in the middle of nowhere. Now, this once thriving village, is
nothing more than a memory, if that. There is no written record anywhere in
this place to hint at anything other than that it was a logging town, nothing
is known about this village. One thing is for certain, it is abandoned and
left in ruins, left to the forest and the forest animals.

An &+yAbandonned Town Hall~
   This is where the members of the community formally met and reviewed
any matter the town might have. Anything from business to the state of security
would be discussed here. They would meet once a month to conduct certain
business concerning the town, at this meeting they would come together and
resolve any unsettled matters. Anything from petty quarrels to large scale
things involving the entire town was resolved here. There are a few tables
and an assortment of furniture still distinguishable, however, much of the former
hall is left in ruins. It must have been a sizable village to have conducted
meetings such as those that went on here because most small towns don't even
bother with such things. This place is dark and damp, and it smells. Outside,
animals rustle in the foliage and leaves, the wind blows, and the trees howl.

A &+gTwisted Path~
    This is a twisted path through a forest. There are a great many obstacles
to overcome if you wish to pass through it. The treacherous paths are cluttered
with dead animals that stink. The ground is covered in leaves. During the
winter when the snow falls it is impossible to walk through this forest without
breaking an ankle because the snow hides the landscape. There are too many
trenches and twisted turns. The trees above hide the sun when it comes out
during the day, making the ground soggy and leaves slippery. This mountain is
sometime the recipient of monsoons, which lasts for days and sometimes weeks.
The peaks of the great mountain is barely visible through the tree limbs and
branches. There are rumors of great evil within this forest, adventurers are
said to enter never to return. The wind blows softly, sending leaves tumbling.

Before a &+yWooden Cottage&n~
   There isn't much to behold on this plateau. There isn't a great deal of
animal life and the plant life is sparse. Water is something of value this high
up in the mountains, one would pay for it dearly if they were without. The
freezing temperatures this high up could more than cause discomfort, it could
cause a sickness, sickness leading to death. There can be no doubt that
shelter is definitely needed for some to sustain life in these mountains.
Protection from wild animals and the weather is an absolute must. There is a
small cottage to the west of here. It was built some time ago by what looks
like human hands. Perhaps some monk or some banished person now resides on
these lands, for whom else would build their home here? There can be little
doubt that whomever lives in that cottage probably isn't friendly, and has no
desire to make friends. Storm clouds like to gather over this plateau, as they
are now, thunder claps are frequent. The wind sends dirt through the air.

A Small &+yTrail &nThrough the &+gWoods~
   This trail is mostly used by the animals that live within this forest. The
forest is densely populated with all sorts of species of wild life. Within
these mountain ranges can be found a great variety of plant life and different
weather conditions as well. Higher above, in the upper part of the mountain,
the weather is cold and the air is light. Here in the bottom, closer to
ground zero, the weather is warm and ripe for supporting plants and animals.
The small breeze stirs the leaves and branches, startling small animals in the
brush. There are a few snake holes visible beneath the leaves and such,
apparently this is a habitat for spineless reptiles as well. There are so
many different ferns visible it is difficult to name them all. Its probable
that not everything growing in this forest is cataloged, some things might be
poisonous without a cure. The night sky brings total darkness to this forest.

A &+yPlateau~
   This rocky mountain plateau stretches for miles. Most spots are traversable,
however, some sections of this plateau aren't reachable through normal means
of travel. There is very little plant life and animal life living on this
barren plateau, just a bunch of rocks and a lot of dirt. The dirt and rocks
aren't anything out of the ordinary, small larger than others and some large
enough to be considered boulders. It doesn't look as if anything ever happens
here, this plateau is barren of nearly all life. Some wild animals roam here
from time to time. Some fur is noticeable along the rock. Some snake skins are
plainly visible amongst the ferns and small weed. This plateau is a lonely
place to spend the night, because of the blanket of night causes temperatures
to drop sharply this high. From this vantage point the mountain range continues
in all directions nearly, however, it seems to end a distance to the north.

   This is a plowed field. There isn't much to be seen here except what remains
of a fertile farm. Weeds now cover the entire field. This was once a productive
farm, now it lays in ruins and is long forgotten. It extends north east and
west quite a ways. Beyond these plowed fields beyond the trees the mountainside
is visible. It is capped with ice and snow. A building lies northward, it
was once a farm house where the farmers lived. Just to the side of it lies the
remnants of a barn. A large shack of lies off to the west, it is ready to
fall over. The farm is surrounded on all sides by a forest. The wind picks up,
sending leaves tumbling down the field. There is an icy chill to the air.

A &+yCozy Cottage&n~
   This cottage was built long ago by a skilled hand. The hand that built it
was by no means adept at construction, however, the precision and care placed
into the layout of the cottage denotes intelligence and heartiness. Such
traits are attributed to monks and mountain men. There is an assortment of robes
hanging near the fireplace on hooks, perhaps they are drying. One of the
two windows of this cottage is boarded shut. The other one has a great view
of the surrounding mountainside. It shows the great forest of the mountain
ranges and the highest peaks of the mountain. There are some snow covered
peaks on some of the higher ones, since the cold air brings snow. Mountains
can change the weather and shape it to its will, it changes the surrounding
countryside's climate and without it, the weather in the surrounding country
would be completely different. There isn't a great deal distinguishing this
cottage from any others, it is just ordinary. A small rug lays on the floor.

A &+yPlateau~
   This rocky mountain plateau stretches for miles. Most spots are traversable,
however, some sections of this plateau aren't reachable through normal means
of travel. There is very little plant life and animal life living on this
barren plateau, just a bunch of rocks and a lot of dirt. The dirt and rocks
aren't anything out of the ordinary, small larger than others and some large
enough to be considered boulders. It doesn't look as if anything ever happens
here, this plateau is barren of nearly all life. Some wild animals roam here
from time to time. Some fur is noticeable along the rock. Some snake skins are
plainly visible amongst the ferns and small weed. This plateau is a lonely
place to spend the night, because of the blanket of night causes temperatures
to drop sharply this high. From this vantage point the mountain range continues
in all directions nearly, however, it seems to end a distance to the north.

A Clearing~
   This is where the forest foliage and trees no longer obstruct the field of
vision. It is here that a clear picture can be painted of the surrounding
countryside. The mountains continue for some more distance to the north. It
clears when it comes to the surrounding countryside. However, to the immediate
north the forest comes twists and turns and follows up to some sort of
settlement. The path leading up to it is long and winding. The settlement
it self is vast and takes up a lot of land. Smoke arises here and they're which
means that the settlement is occupied, which means people. Much of the
countryside obstructs the view of the settlement, it could very well be a large
city. The mountain surrounds the small city, and the forest within surrounds
the path leading up to it. The wind blows steadily and brings the scent of
freshly cooked meat.

Before a Small &+yEncampment&n~
   The forest isn't very thick here. There has been an encampment set up here
by a large party of caravans. A number of clothes hang from some these
caravans and some are hanging on line running from tree to tree, they are
hanging out to dry. There are a few fires running, one or two cooking meat and
boiling water. One or two dogs bark. Sounds of celebration and joy come from
the center of the encampment, it seems as if they are enjoying themselves
immensely. The caravans form a semi-circle and number around a dozen. There
are mules and horses and other beasts of burden to carry there loads and pull
their wagons tied to trees, some grazes openly. There are a few small piles of
waste from these beasts, they smell sends a small detectable odor throughout
the woods. The crackling of the fire and the scent of meat is great. The
forest is thick outside this encampment, it would be difficult to find a trail.

A Small &+yEncampment &nof &+gTinkers~
   Tinkers have taken up residence here. There are a number of caravans
parked in a semicircle to form a tight ring, which provides some security and
comfort to them. It is from experience that these traveling people do things,
they are weary of all things, accepting of most things, and an underprivileged
people who just enjoy traveling and experiencing new things. They are known
to wear bright clothing and really outlandish costumes on a normal basis. Some
could even consider them clowns when they're in public. Their eye bleeding
rags and naive tongue get them into trouble more often than not in the larger
cities, which is why they stick together and avoid the larger populace. These
tinkers know how to have a good time though, sounds of music fill the air and
the scent of freshly cooked meat salivates the mouth. The forest thickens in
nearly every direction, it would be difficult to push a caravan party through.

A Small &+yTrail &nThrough the &+gWoods~
   This trail is mostly used by the animals that live within this forest. The
forest is densely populated with all sorts of species of wild life. Within
these mountain ranes can be found a great variety of plant life and different
weather conditions as well. Higher above, in the upper part of the mountain,
the weather is cold and the air is light. Here in the bottom, closer to
ground zero, the weather is warm and ripe for supporting plants and animals.
The small breeze stirs the leaves and branches, startling small animals in the
brush. There are a few snake holes visible beneath the leaves and such,
apparently this is a habitat for spineless reptiles as well. There are so
many different ferns visible it is difficult to name them all. Its probable
that not everything growing in this forest is cataloged, some things might be
poisonous without a cure. The night sky brings total darkness to this forest.

A Large &+yField &nBefore a &+yMountain &+gForest~
   The grass grows tall and continues for what seems like forever here. This
field has been around for centuries and stood the test of time. There are
small hills running up and down, which blocks some of the fields wonder,
preventing total line of site. These rolling foothills are prelude to the
forest and the mountain ranges to the south. These mountains are said to be
impassible. Stories are told far and wide of the death that awaits the unwary
traveler and the difficulties faced. Rumors have spread that there is a dark
mage that resides in his tower, huddled in mystery and cloaked in death. No
one living has discovered his secrets, and lived. Some stories involve a
barbarian encampment deep within the mountain peaks, secluded much as they
like it to be. These barbarians are not friendly to the living, nor to the
dead. When the breeze picks up, it gently blows the tall grass to one side.

A Large &+yField &nBefore a &+yMountain &+gForest~
   The grass grows tall and continues for what seems like forever here. This
field has been around for centuries and stood the test of time. There are
small hills running up and down, which blocks some of the fields wonder,
preventing total line of site. These rolling foothills are prelude to the
forest and the mountain ranges to the south. These mountains are said to be
impassible. Stories are told far and wide of the death that awaits the unwary
traveler and the difficulties faced. Rumors have spread that there is a dark
mage that resides in his tower, huddled in mystery and cloaked in death. No
one living has discovered his secrets, and lived. Some stories involve a
barbarian encampment deep within the mountain peaks, secluded much as they
like it to be. These barbarians are not friendly to the living, nor to the
dead. When the breeze picks up, it gently blows the tall grass to one side.

A &+yRocky Mountain Path~
   This mountain path is rarely used, if it ever was. There is no evidence that
it is used frequently by anything other than wild animals. The number of
wild beasts that live amongst the mountains are few in number, however, they
are very dangerous. Anything from bobcats to wild snakes live in this sort of
habitat. There is an occasional presence along the trail of these creatures,
they mostly stay hidden and are rarely seen by humanoids. These animals have
a sixth sense and can sense an intruder or another presence in their domain.
Small boulders and jagged edged rocks lay here and there inhibiting any sort
of traveling, preventing carriages and even horses from having an easy time.
Nothing frequents these parts of the mountainside much. Dark clouds hang down
from the sky. Storms are frequent and unavoidable here, shelter is a must.

Along the &+yMountain Peaks~
   There can be no doubt that a fall from this altitude would result in death.
There is no place to land that would be gentle, there are just too many rocks
and even more dangerous niches in this mountain that would spell doom. From
this altitude much is visible of the surrounding landscape. The mountain is
densely populated with forest. The cliffs and mountain range far to eitherside
eastward and westward are covered with snow and ice at their peaks because
they rise even higher than here. There is some sort of settlement far to the
west of here, it stretches for some distance and seems to be heavily populated.
The nightsky here can be lonely and cold, being exposed to the elements for
even one night could be no less than troublesome. Animals rustle the brush.

Before a &+yRocky Ascent&n~
   There are a great many jagged rocks inhibiting travel in this so called
trail to ascend the mountain slope. The trail continues to rise a good distance
and goes on for quiet some distance. Trailing these treacherous mountain
cliffs unprepared can only result in death or injury. Only experienced mountain
climbers should even attempt to climb the total ascent of the mountain,
however, this trail doesn't seem overly treacherous, but not for the unwary
or unprepared. It runs a quite a distance in to the north where a few larger
ascents are visible, ascents requiring rope or any other means to scale. There
are a few nests visible along the cliffs, they belong to the bird wild life.
A small breeze picks up, sending small pebbles through the air.

A Small &+yVillage Trail~
   This small village trail leads directly into the village that once stood
here. It was once a logger village but now is abandoned. The plant has come
alive and overtaken much of the village and the forest has taken up residence
here were the loggers once did. The timber has rotted and decayed away and
is barely discernable from the foliage. There was once life in this village,
now there is not. It was not a large one, however, it consisted of a number
of small buildings and a couple of larger ones. It is impossible to discern
the nature of these buildings, because they are in now a crumbled heap. The
trail is covered in foliage and some refuse. This village once thrived, and for
reasons unknown, it was abandoned and now is dead.

An &+yAbandonned Cottage&n~
   This cottage has been abandoned for what looks like a century. It seems
as if the roof is collapsing and it doesn't look at all stable, almost as if
a slight breeze could cause it to cave in. There doesn't seem to be any
evidence that this cottage has been used for anything by anyone or nearly
anything, aside form the plants and animals that have overtaken it. It stinks
inside here, as there is nothing to circulate the foul air out and allow
clean air in. This must have been a cottage for one of the logging families
that lived in this village, however, like everything else in this village, it
has long since been abandoned and lays now in ruins. The floor is ready to
fall in, the walls look terrible, it would be best not to stay here long.

Before a &+yCollapsed Barn~
   There are a great many trees here. They block out nearly all of the sunlight
that would otherwise reach the small trail. This trail was once used a long
time ago by a number of villagers that used to inhabit this village, this
longing village. It must have produced a great deal of lumber to have grown
into such a sizable settlement such as this. With so many villagers living and
working in this village, they must have come up with some sort of council and
or a leadership committee of some sort. This once thriving village however, is
now deserted. Much of what remains has been overtaken by the forest, and much
that once was is now left in ruins. So many of the well built cottages and
establishments constructed here have now fallen. A large barn was built here
long ago, it tells a story of ages past. Centuries must have passed since this
barn was built, and it still stands as a tribute to the workmanship of those
who put it together. It looks nearly collapsed do to the rotting of the wood
and weight build up of the vines and other forestation on it. In its day, it
must have held a great many animals, now a small breeze could cause it to
collapse. An eerie breeze stirs.

Within an &+yAncient Barn&n~
   This barn is now centuries old. It was built by the villagers who inhabited
this logging camp, and they were no doubt themselves somehow affiliated with
carpentry because the workmanship on this barn was outstanding. This logging
camp must have had a number of horses and mules kept within this barn because
the size of it speaks volumes. Any number of beasts could be kept safely within
this barn, there are dozens of stalls and a large loft. Although most of this
barn still stands, it has seen better days and looks ready to collapse. Plants
and animals have taken over this barn now. It is no longer usable. The mold and
dampness of the air causes a foul odor here. The pungent stench of animal waste
is difficult to ignore. There is nothing out of the ordinary as the wind
creates a stir in the air, causing a light sharp whistle through the barn.

A &+gDense Forest~
   A long time ago a village once stood here. This village was created by a
few loggers looking to develop a place of trade. Slowly, this village grew
do to the arise of new needs. With the arrival of new people came the
inevitable growth and the development of town. The small town was self
sufficient and needed no outside help to thrive on its own, however, it did
trade on a regular basis, which helped it grow further. Skilled craftsman
were drawn to this large village and so were many different crafts and trades.
Somehow, long ago, this thriving village was cursed by some horrible force,
an evil force. These people, and others like them, were cursed into oblivion
and the village that was there's is there's no longer. Where once stood log
cabins now stands piles of refuse. Where once hunters hunted now there are
dead wood. The children once played regularly, now it is difficult to imagine
children here at all. The village that once was here, has slowly succumbed to
the forest. There is hardly any evidence that there was once a village here,
aside from the refuse of the wooden buildings that stood centuries ago.

The &+yImpassible Mountains &nof &+rPain~
   These mountains are rumored to be impassible. Not a single living being is
said to have traversed these mountains unscathed by the treacherous paths and
ferocious beasts that make up the habitat. There is little doubt that these
beasts roam wild here, it is understood that entering these mountains all
control from the outside world is lost, entering these mountains means being
completely on your own. The mountain rises a great distance into the sky.
Clouds surround the mountain peaks here and there, further secluding it and
creating even more mystery and ominous thoughts. It is rumored that a great
barbarian encampment is at the very top of this great mountain, and that they
do not welcome visitors. It is also said that a great evil magi, an undead
magi, practices some dark arcane art hidden away in his tower. There are
dark powers at work in these mountains, and they are untouched by powers other
than that of the mountain itself. This great mountain is a wonder of the world.

A &+yRocky Path~
   There are a number of trees here. Despite the trees rising hundreds of feet
into the air, the mountain peaks are visible. This mountain range envelops
this forest and surrounds it on all sides. It is rumored that these dangerous
rocky mountain slopes are impassible. At the top of the mountain peaks are
plateaus of ice, and dry cold air. With such high altitudes the temperature
drops and the air thins, not much could live there. There is rumored to be
some sort of barbarian encampment there. No expedition has ever been sent to
find or dislodge these icy mountain nomads, however, none is needed. They are
rarely spoken of, let alone seen. They are undoubtedly hostile to all
outsiders. There are a number of rocks here, large and small. Beasts are sure
to roam in this part of the mountain range, dangerous beasts looking to
protect their territory. A small rock slides down a slope.

Along the &+yMountain Peaks~
   There can be no doubt that a fall from this altitude would result in death.
There is no place to land that would be gentle, there are just too many rocks
and even more dangerous niches in this mountain that would spell doom. From
this altitude much is visible of the surrounding landscape. The mountain is
densely populated with forest. The cliffs and mountain range far to either side
eastward and westward are covered with snow and ice at their peaks because
they rise even higher than here. There is some sort of settlement far to the
west of here, it stretches for some distance and seems to be heavily populated.
The night sky here can be lonely and cold, being exposed to the elements for
even one night could be no less than troublesome. Animals rustle the brush.

Before a &+yRocky Ascent&n~
   There are a great many jagged rocks inhibiting travel in this so called
trail to ascend the mountain slope. The trail continues to rise a good distance
and goes on for quiet some distance. Trailing these treacherous mountain
cliffs unprepared can only result in death or injury. Only experienced mountain
climbers should even attempt to climb the total ascent of the mountain,
however, this trail doesn't seem overly treacherous, but not for the unwary
or unprepared. It runs a quite a distance in to the north where a few larger
ascents are visible, ascents requiring rope or anyother means to scale. There
are a few nests visible along the cliffs, they belong to the bird wild life.
A small breeze picks up, sending small pebbles through the air.

Along the &+yMountain Peaks~
   There can be no doubt that a fall from this altitude would result in death.
There is no place to land that would be gentle, there are just too many rocks
and even more dangerous niches in this mountain that would spell doom. From
this altitude much is visible of the surrounding landscape. The mountain is
densely populated with forest. The cliffs and mountain range far to eitherside
eastward and westward are covered with snow and ice at their peaks because
they rise even higher than here. There is some sort of settlement far to the
west of here, it stretches for some distance and seems to be heavily populated.
The nightsky here can be lonely and cold, being exposed to the elements for
even one night could be no less than troublesome. Animals rustle the brush.

Below a &+yCliff~
   Above, there is a cliff. Jagged rocks make scaling this cliff a difficult
task better left untried. There are a number of ways for someone to lose their
footing trying to ascend to greater height, and even more perilous things
probably await at the top. There are no charts or maps to this mountain, and
many explorers have prepared expeditions only to stop short of launching. The
few brave enough to try explore these hostile mountains were never seen or
heard from again. There are a few ferns growing along the rocks on the mountain
side. There are any number of animals that come out during the night that hide
out during the day in the crevices and niches of the mountain. The night sky
certainly breathes a cold breeze and a cold death to some. Storm clouds are
known to part for this mountain. Gods are said to have walked its peaks. There
must be some way to ascend to the top of the cliff. A rock falls from above.

control from the outside world is lost, entering these mountains means being
completely on your own. The mountain rises a great distance into the sky.
Clouds surround the mountain peaks here and there, further secluding it and
creating even more mystery and ominous thoughts. It is rumored that a great
barbarian encampment is at the very top of this great mountain, and that they
do not welcome visitors. It is also said that a great evil magi, an undead
magi, practices some dark arcane art hidden away in his tower. There are
dark powers at work in these mountains, and they are untouched by powers other
than that of the mountain itself. This great mountain is a wonder of the world.

A &+yRocky Path~
   There are a number of trees here. Despite the trees rising hundreds of feet
into the air, the mountain peaks are visible. This mountain range envelopes
this forest and surrounds it on all sides. It is rumored that these dangerous
rocky mountain slopes are impassible. At the top of the mountain peaks are
plateaus of ice, and dry cold air. With such high altitudes the temperature
drops and the air thins, not much could live there. There is rumored to be
some sort of barbarian encampment there. No expedition has ever been sent to
find or dislodge these icy mountain nomads, however, none is needed. They are
rarely spoken of, let alone seen. They are undoubtedly hostile to all
outsiders. There are a number of rocks here, large and small. Beasts are sure
to roam in this part of the mountain range, dangerous beasts looking to
protect there territory. A small rock slides down a slope.

Before a &+yRocky Ascent&n~
   There are a great many jagged rocks inhibiting travel in this so called
trail to ascend the mountain slope. The trail continues to rise a good distance
and goes on for quiet some distance. Trailing these treacherous mountain
cliffs unprepared can only result in death or injury. Only experienced mountain
climbers should even attempt to climb the total ascent of the mountain,
however, this trail doesn't seem overly treacherous, but not for the unwary
or unprepared. It runs a quite a distance in to the north where a few larger
ascents are visible, ascents requiring rope or any other means to scale. There
are a few nests visible along the cliffs, they belong to the bird wild life.
A small breeze picks up, sending small pebbles through the air.

Along the &+yMountain Peaks~
   There can be no doubt that a fall from this altitude would result in death.
There is no place to land that would be gentle, there are just too many rocks
and even more dangerous niches in this mountain that would spell doom. From
this altitude much is visible of the surrounding landscape. The mountain is
densely populated with forest. The cliffs and mountain range far to either side
eastward and westward are covered with snow and ice at their peaks because
they rise even higher than here. There is some sort of settlement far to the
west of here, it stretches for some distance and seems to be heavily populated.
The night sky here can be lonely and cold, being exposed to the elements for
even one night could be no less than troublesome. Animals rustle the brush.

On the Brim of a &+rVolcano~
   It is well known on the outside world that in the middle of the mountains
of pain lies a volcano. It hasn't erupted in recent memory, however, it is an
active volcano with lava flowing readily. The heat from this the lava can be
felt here, despite it being some hundreds of feet into the volcano and
underneath hundreds of feet of rock. There is a straight hundred-foot drop
into the volcano's base, which is nothing but harden lava covered in ash.
There aren't any animals or plants anyplace near this place, they know better.
Only fools come this close to a volcano. Fire ants are known to live among the
lava and in other fiery infernos. These ants are deadly and strike with deadly
venom and are engulfed in flames. At these altitudes the air is thin, making
breathing enough oxygen all the more important. It is also very cold here.
Clouds encircle the mountain's peaks above. A gentle breeze stirs.

Above a &+RNarrow Lava Tube~
   There is a great lake of fire buried deep below. It isn't obvious at first,
but there is a small opening in the dried lava basin revealing flowing lava.
It isn't a large opening and is very narrow. This volcano is an active one,
and it isn't surprising to find that lava flows freely under the mountain. If
it were to erupt, it would spell devastation to the surrounding countryside.
Fortunately, there hasn't been an eruption in quite sometime. The climb to the
base of the volcano is a treacherous one, plagued by jagged rocks and any
number of things that could spell doom. When a breeze picks up, it sends ash
through the air. When it rains at this high of an altitude, a terrible mist
soon follows. The warmness of the volcano contrasts with the cold air.

A &+LDormant &+rLava&n-&+yTube~
   Years ago this tube must have run full of lava. Now this tube is nothing
more than a shaft that runs the distance of the under mountain. It is uncertain
just how far this tube stretches, however, it is a good bet that it runs
the distance of the mountain and even further. The lava hasn't run here in
quite sometime. The dried lava looks peculiar, as if molded. It is unremarkable
but looks funny. There can be no way of telling if anyone has traversed these
tubes. There are only two ways to travel from this point on, to the west and
to the east. Both tubes look similar, however, the east one looks a little
cramped. The smell of sulfur lingers in the air, since there is no way to
ventilate the tunnels it will remain here for quite some time.
