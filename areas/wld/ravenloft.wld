   &+LThis rocky plateau at the very top of Mount Ravenloft bridges the
&+Lhuge steep incline west of here to the courtyard east of here, just
&+Lsouth of the great Castle Ravenloft on the higheast peaks of this
&+Lmountain.  All of the Svalich Woods as well as the Barovia wilderness
&+Lcan be seen in the clouded distance below here.

&+Wgargoyles of vampires, open into the Castle Proper of Ravenloft.  The great

   &+mEvery several feet in either direction on this incline leading to
&+mCastle Ravenloft to the east burns a small torch atop a silverish pole
&+mon either side of this rocky incline.  The gentle, and softly-fuzzing
&+mmagical crackling of these torches enhances the mood produced by the
&+mserene, yet breathtakingly beautiful view of Barovia below.  From this
&+mvantage point one can see the gentle kiss of the pillowish clouds on
&+mthe tips of the finger-like branch tips of the Svalich trees.
   &+rBlood, guts, tortured comrades, helpless bleeding, dying...
   &+rFerocious nightmares eventually consume the thoughts of any mortal
&+rwith the brave desparity to conquer such a fretful, vengeful, terrible
&+rdomain.

&+Llooks out among the west.  The darkness of Castle Ravenloft is so thick,
&+Lhowever, that the foot of the Alduran Mountains is the furthest thing

&+Lruns through the mountains and crashes over in the scenic falls, all
&+Lthe while Barovia is being consumed by the creeping Svalich woods.

&+Chowever by far in the longest run of the Castle it has been Strahd who has
&+Chorded the treasury to himself, as lord of the castle and self-proclaimed
&+CFirst Vampire, it was quite easy for Strahd to claim the castle and every-

&+Cbeing used.  A small wooden door opens up to the east.

&+Wa massive, cavernous underworld chasm.  A small stone bridge leads to a small
&+Wentrance, crafted of stone blocks in an arch, on a natural rock formation
&+Won the far side of the chasm.  This arched entrance bares a huge single svalich
&+Wwood door, braced with diorite bands and huge diorite screws.  A large stone
&+Wknocked is fastened to the center of the aged, cracked, yet magical door.
&+WA very small plaque with ancient writing is mounted to this door, revealing
&+Wthe contents behind this door to be known as the Ravenloft Catacombs, the
&+Wancient burial sanctuary that bares the bodies of the entire Zarovich lineage,
&+Wincluding Sengir von Zarovich, Father of Strahd.

&+LThe Vaulted &+yCaves &+Lof the &+GO&+gbyrith &+rLair&N~
   &+LThese massive &+ycaves&+L have hanging stalagmites and massive rocky protrusions
&+Ljutting out from the ground.  Multi-tiered stairs lead from one huge cave to
&+Lanother.  There are numerous &+Wskulls&+L and totems as well as pikes with &+rheads&+L lined
&+Lup them mounted every several paces.  This large, wide-open cave-system leads
&+Lup to a small sacrificial platform in the middle, in which ancient and&+C magical
&+Lrituals are performed by these demon lords.  Strange natural abyssal growths
&+Lcover the core of &+mZionyn&+L.

&+LThe &+mMain &+LHallway&N~
   &+LThis large hallway travels north and south through Castle Ravenloft's
&+Lsecond floor.  This castle is very high up, as the clouds outside creep
&+Lin creating a fog on the floor of these halls.  Spiderwebs cover everything
&+Las it is also dark and quite dusty.  The carpetted floor, however, is
&+Lquite lavish as it leads through this main hallway.

   &+LTwisting and turning, forever churning, this deep shaft deep within the
&+Lheart of the planet &+mZionyn&+L, staple feature of the &+M663rd level&+L of

&+Lhive, in which the great lord and king of the &+mZionyn &+Ltanar'ri &+WO&+mb&+Lox&+WO&+mb&+L resides.
&+LJagged natural, piercing rocks jut out at all sides of this deep and dark shaft
&+Lto the lair of &+WO&+mb&+Lox-&+WO&+mb&+L himself.

&+LThe &+yLair&+L of the &+rObyrith King &+WO&+mb&+Lox-&+WO&+mb&N~
   &+LThis large cave opens to a huge pool of slime, in which a massive bone throne
&+Lsits half-submerged.  This glorious throne juts several feet high into the
&+Lair of this jagged cavern, made up of various bones of tanar'ri of many
&+Lbreeds.  The pool of slime is thick and viscid, much like that experienced
&+Lin the earlier 663rd plane, which simply existed as a mere asteroid floating
&+Lthrough abyssal space.  It is clear as to how Obox-ob's power has grown
&+Lthroughout the centuries difference in creating such a huge dynasty and planet
&+Lknown as Zionyn.

&+Wfrom here, the 663rd layer of the Abyss, while the top of the HighTower
&+Wof Castle &+rRavenloft &+Wcan be seen just beyond this glimpse of

&+RThe Private Quarters of Strahd Von Zarovich&N~
   &+RAt the Head of the &+LCourt of the Count&+R, this private chamber serves as
&+Rthe main petitioning room where Strahd may decide to hear out the pleas of his
&+Rsubjects who he has brought to this Court.  One can see the age in this office
&+Rsimply by the design of the furniture.  Made quite some time ago, sometime bet-
&+Rween the Second and Third Wars, his furniture bares that Victorian, elegant
&+Rlook.  Plush velvet lined chairs sit in front of a huge judge-sized desk.  Two
&+Rsmall candles burn a &+Bbluish &+Rflames in front of a roster of attendees.
&+ROn each corner of this chamber, a large banner bearing the &+rRavenloft &+Rcrest
&+Rdangles from a silver flag pole.  The floor to this chamber is made of blocked,
&+Relegant marble.  A red carpet sits across the glossy marble, leading from the
&+Rdoorway to the east up to a small wooden gate around the Count's personal podium.
