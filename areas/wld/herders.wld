&NCarved Passage through the &+yMountains~
   &+yThis passage through the mountains is carved out of what seems to be
&+yunbreakable rock, but burn marks and a perfect cut are apparent on all
&+yof the edges.  A passageway opens north into a dark, foreboding landmass
&+ythat looks to have some sort of towers above it.

&+LA Passage Between the &+yRocks~
   &+LThis enormous passage between the rocks extends at least fifty to
&+Lsixty feet in either direction.  There are scorch marks all over the
&+Lblack, lifeless earth.  The rocks to the east and west are smooth and
&+Lblackened with burn marks and resonate terrible black magics.

&+yWilds&+L of Shizmaah Next to the Southern Dark Spire~
    &+LThis portion of the wilds of Shizmaah is right next to a huge
&+Lspire that reaches up through the cavern like the blade of a dagger
&+Lrising through a recently backstabbed victim.  The tower goes up
&+Las far as the eye can see disappearing into the darkness.  There
&+Lappears not to be any entryway from down here, but there are possibly
&+Lother entrances.

&+LA &+rPrisoner &+LCell Block&N~
   &+LThis portion of the tunnel opens up to several different prisoner
&+Lcells. Each contains a recently captured inmate of the undead.
&+LThe only glimpse of hope for these prisoners is to die fighting
&+Lbefore they become executed or a slave of the undead.  This cell
&+Lblock serves as a connecting room for individual cells of the
&+Lcaptives.

&+LLocated on the northern side of this chamber is a huge

&+Lwhatsoever, as the undead prefer to live in complete darkness.  The
&+Lechos of undying screams can be heard to the south.
