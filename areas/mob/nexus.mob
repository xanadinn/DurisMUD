&+GA massive green scaled dragon with no wings closes in to devour its prey.

&+GThis green dragon has no wings. It lives deep within the forest where it has
&+Gno use for them. Having no wings doesn't make this predator any less
&+Gthreatening, it actually makes it a more ferocious fighter because of its
&+Ginferiority complex, it also makes him angry at the rest of the world. The
&+Geyes of this dragon glow &+Bblue&+G as it roars vehemently. The scales of this
&+Gmassive dragon keep missiles from inflicting harm, and its magic resistance
&+Gkeeps most spells from bombarding its body. Its mouth could spew gas or acid
&+Gin a moment's notice. Its razor sharp claws and stinger on its tail could
&+Gimpale anyone, even with the strongest of armors, at anytime. Every part of
&+Gthis dragon is a weapon, even its icy gaze, for dragon fear is the worst
&+Gweapon in its arsonal. It could effectively reduce an army to a bunch of ants
&+Gawaiting to be squashed with its mere presence.

a tatooed &+Chuman&n~
A &+Chuman&n with bandaged hands and jet black hair raises an eyebrow.
~
This human has bandages on his hands. These bandages were meant to conceal his
tatooes underneath, and coneal them they do, but not totally. Some parts of his
upper hands have tatoos noticably. The bandages also do not cover his neck,
where a few tatoos are evident. One could speculate that all of his body is
tatooed, however, who would do such a thing. The man's jet black hair is very
peculiar and it is very long. He stands a little over six feet tall, with
broad muscles. Although the presence of a dragon would frighten most, this man
didn't seem to be affected by the massive green scaled dragon that was about
to devour him and his companions, perhaps he is mentally unstable, or an even
more far out hypothesis is he was unafraid because he was never in danger.
Perhaps he and the dragon were a team, or perhaps this man is also powerful in
magic, and chooses to conceal himself for now.

a &+Ymountain dwarf&n~
A&+Y mountain dwarf&n grins a wicked grin and expects imenent doom.
~
This mountain dwarf stands a little above four feet tall. He seems anxious
about something, although who could blame him. Although his campanions were
frightened to death of the doom the wingless dragon brought, he seemed to
revel in it. Perhaps he doesn't share the same goal as his fellow travelers,
maybe he harbors secret sinister thoughts and expects doom at anytime. This
dwarf wear's a medallion around his neck with a strange rune embedded into it.
The rune has a magical aura around it, although it isn't very strong. The
dwarf's eyes seem to light up whenever he glances at it, as if remembering
times long since passed. His wiskers stick straight out as if in deep thought,
as if contemplating whether or not his inheretence is worth anything, his
inheretence from his people recently just slaughtered by giant psionicists,
the beholders of such power the world has never seen. These giants destroyed
his people, destroyed the elfs, destroyed the humans, and every other life
in their former home. "If only they would've helped us, elven magic could've
saved my people." he thinks.

An &+gelven&n woman stands with her sword drawn in a fighting stance.
~
With her sword drawn she stands in an ancient elven battle stance. She was
taught by her tutors to never show any fear in the before battle or mercy in
the wake of it. She was one of the first to react in the face of danger, she
turned sharply on her heel with her sword drawn and prepared to meet her fate,
even if fighting was futile she would not face death on unhonorably. The older
elf, her brother, took to her side to meet the same fate as his sister, both
with their arms drawn prepared for battle. There were no battle cries or
shreiks from either one of them, nor were their any from the humans whome they
distrust and dispise, much to their disappointment. Their ancient homeworld,
their people were destroyed by giants who were unleashed into the world by
the humans, or so they believe, and so they have every right to hate and loth
humans and dwarfs.

a &+Chuman &nfemale~
A &+Chuman &nfemale shrieks in horror as the dragon approaches.
~
This woman has had a rough life. Her and her brother have been living as
mercenaries since they were barely out of their diapers. They were left
parentless when their mother died of abruptly from a war she never took part
in, but obviously suffered from. Since that moment they were children no
longer, they were forced to fend for themselves. The war was with the elves,
and they've sense held deep resentment for all that is elven. Even the elven
ship that was used to fly through the sky and out into space to land them where
they are now, which saved their very lives is held in disgust. If it weren't
for imenent death they would've never relied upon another, especially an
elf for support. She stands under six feet tall, around five foot six to be
exact, with long brown hair and a beautiful face. Some have said that she
could've had royal blood in her veins, and if it weren't for the fact that
her mother was a whore, she might have some. Or even yet likely, her mother had
royal clientel, who secretly bought off her silence.

A bumbling old &+Mmagician&n mumbles something about the spell fireball.
~
This old magician wears mouse colored robes. He bumbles on and looks ready to
trip over his own two feet mumbling something about a powerful magic spell
call fireball. "If only I could remember how it goes, fir.., fireturkey,
firemart, fir...." His pointy top hat looks nearly done in, with its fiber
nearly worn, a simple touch could unwind the entire thing. The robes flow
freely around his body, and he doesn't have a component belt for his spells.
His long flowing beard looks far too long for it drops just above his solar
plexus. The brow on his forehead are full of lines and wrinckles, this magi
is truly old, although his voice sounds vibrant and shows no signs of any
weakness, if it weren't for him talking nonsense that is. This man doesn't
seem affected by the outside world, as if too senile to realize that he's in
anykind of danger. But, perhaps there is more to this man than the image he
projects, perhaps there lies more under the mask than out.

Having grown up practically an orphan, this guy has had a rough life. He and
his sister have spent all of their lives fending for themselves, it's a wonder
they're still alive. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, if this holds
true then this guy must be one bad mother. Since he was a little boy not barely
out of his diapers has this guy been working, doing odd jobs when and this and
that when he was little to eventually graduating to a full fledged mercenary
for which he is now. He wears a cloth shirt around his upper torso and leather
studded pants on his legs. His shirt exposes a little of his upper chest, very
provocative for the ladies. But, such is not the life this man has led, he's
known only pain in his twenty five years, he and his sister. His brow tightens
as he expects imenent danger from the wingless dragon that's been tracking them
all through the forest and then some, if only he could devise a plan to get
them into the castle to the north, but it is locked.

&+CRoxon is one of the best known shamans of Mugnork. He seems to find enjoyment
&+Cwith being reknown and receives his drinks for free at the pub. Drinking is
&+Cone of his favorite things to do next to summoning. His powerful art is
&+Cderived from the influence of his father, because like him, he too was a
&+Cpowerful shaman. He sits behind the table like he always does when he
&+Cfrequents the pub, drinking himself into a tupor. When he's not doing that,
&+Che's doing what he likes to call creative work in bed with women.

&+YYunger&n~
&+YYunger&n, the &+Yleg&+Wend&+Yary &+Ldra&+Wgon &+Lfig&+Whter&n, prepares to embark on a crusade.
~
&+YThis barbarian stands six foot six and towers over the strong and grits his
&+Yteeth against the cold as he stands nearly naked in battle as he faces an
&+Yonslaught of enemies with the only intent to skewer him onto their blade and
&+Yforever become known as the warrior who took the &+Yleg&+Wend&+Yary &+Ldra&+Wgon &+Lfig&+Whter&+Y.
&+YHis life prior to becoming the warrior of legend was that of an ordinary
&+Yswordsman mercenary who took up the craft out of necessity just like all those
&+Ywho live in the wild but became something more and stood out against the crowd
&+Ybecause of his eagerness to face oncoming and pursuing threats that no other
&+Ywould seek out or contend with. This led him to face quests and confront demons
&+Yand sorcerers that others could only claim to hear rumors of, but not because
&+Yhe saught fame and fortune, but because it was his calling through meditation
&+Yand soul searching. His claim to fame is through valor, repute, and valuing
&+Ydrivers of honor and dignity that others can not.
