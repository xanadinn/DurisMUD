chicken~
&+Wa chicken&N~
&+WA &+Ychicken &+Wpecks at the ground, ignoring you.&N
~
&+YThis small animal pecks at the ground here in search of insects and seeds.
&+YIt looks fully used to people, and only moves when one almost walks into
&+Yit. Its feathers are a dirty shade of white, and it moves its head about
&+Yin a bobbing fasion as it looks for any motion that may identify a meal.
&+YThis chicken is pretty self sufficient, and the farmer need only feed it
&+Ywhen the season is winter or early spring because during the other seasons
&+Yit can take care of itself. It must know the area well, as it moves about
&+Ycomfortably and without worry. It clucks contently as it goes about its way.&N

cow~
&+ya cow&N~
&+yA cow stands here chewing &+gcud&+y, looking at you with a dull expression.&N
~
&+yA large mammal, this cow is kept by the villagers for its milk and meat.
&+yWhile it serves them well and is able to give good amounts of milk, it is
&+ycertain of being fed bountifully and being let to graze on the nicest of
&+yfields. When its production falters as it ages, chances are it will end up
&+yon the cutting block of the butcher. Somewhere between this, it will give
&+ybirth to several calfs, providing its owner with future livestock. As you
&+yobserve it, the cow looks back at you with an emotionless and rather stupid
&+ylooking gaze while it chews on some grass. It then looks away, and lowers
&+yits neck to gather another mouthful of green.&N

&+MThis female pig lies in the earth here, its right side up. It looks like
&+Ma fine creature that is leading a happy life here in the village, able to
&+Mwallow in the mud, eat to its heart's content and wander where it likes.
&+Mthe price of this however is of course its life, for after it has served
&+Mits master by providing him with a steady stream of little piglets, there
&+Mis only one task left and that is to provide him with food. This sow is
&+Moblivious of that however, and until that time it is having a good life

&+Mmerrily in delight as it finds something that it likes before running off
&+Melsewhere. There is a great deal of them, each one performing the same kind
&+Mof behavior, and the presence of their brothers and sisters seems to only
&+Minvigorate them more. The piglet looks to be several months old.&N

&+MOne of the many pigs in town, this one is busy digging a shallow hole in

&+Mmove its nose around. Perhaps it smelt a root, or it is in search of some
&+Minsects. It is obviously female as can be clearly seen by the nipples on
&+Mits belly, and they have been used to suckle piglets because they are a
&+Mlittle bit elongated. It is not tied to anything and the farmer must be
&+Mcertain that it will not wander off into the woods. Every so often, it
&+Mlets go a deep oink. It looks to be a healthy and happy pig.&N

&+Lmake a lunge towards it. The raven has pitch black feathers and it is
&+Lremarkably large, perhaps the usual sight of a small bird in the air has
&+Ldiminished it in one's mind. It is totally silent but moves it head with

&+cnone of the stress, noise and crime that its nearby neighbor does. The man

&+CRalg is a man of average height but his profession has endowed him with

&+Cand farming instruments. In fact, as long as it is metal, he can likely
&+Cconstruct or fix it. He sticks to these items mainly however, as there is

&+Ctufts here and there. He is not creating an item at the moment, instead
&+Cmaking sure his forge is at a good heat so that he may use it soon. Ralg
&+Cgreets you and makes a sweeping motion with his arm over the tables with
&+Citems on both sides of the store, inviting you to have a look at them.&N

&+cmemories to them. The old townsman looks at you and nods his head, and
&+cthen starts a story to the others about how there never used to be this
&+cmuch outsiders in the old days. They all have something to say and it is
&+chard to catch any of it with the multitude of old, grizzled voices speaking

&+whangs down the length of her neck. The lines around her nose, mouth and
&+weyes have etched deep over the many years of her life and her face is now
&+wwrinkled. The deepest of the grooves are laugh lines, so she still looks
&+wyoung in a certain sense. She is somewhat short and plump, and does not
&+wwear any jewelry or other trinkets. She is busy talking and does not look
&+wat you when you approach. Perhaps it is a daily ritual for them to meet.&N

&+RDressed in a red robe with crimson streaks, this man's movements are flashes

&+Rfor a very long time - longer than most can remember, even the village elders.
&+RThe wizard looks to be in his early fifties but this is obviously not his real
&+Rage, as he has been in the village over twice as long. He has no beard, which
&+Rmay seem strange for someone of his profession, and his hair is not silver but
&+Rplain brown. He looks at you somewhat condescendingly, and his eyes implore
&+Ryou to speak of your business here. Perhaps he expects you to be a messenger
&+Rfrom the village to the north, or an apprentice from one of his peers sent to
&+Rpick up a magical item or spell component. The mage does not yet speak.&N

&+yThis wooden man looks like a simple carving made from a tree trunk. His
&+yfeatures are very simple. When you enter the room, his head suddenly turns
&+yand he looks at you! He must have been created by the mage using a strange
&+yspell. The wooden man is a golem, an animated object fashioned from any

&+ythe golem is directly proportionate to the value of the material used.
&+yThis one would not be very strong, but still his creation would have been

&+mhorns protruding from its head and a mouth full of relatively large teeth.
&+mThe imp has beady, pitch-black eyes, and one cannot immediately tell what

&+ychildren in town who might not have the understanding how to deal with such

&+WOne of the village's &+Ycraftsmen &+Wworks on something that cannot be determined yet.&N
~
&+WSitting on a bench placed at the side of the village square, this man is
&+Wis working on what looks like a basket. It is half finished, many twigs
&+Wsticking out at the top of the edges, ready to be woven into new circles
&+Wto make the basket deeper. The twigs are a pale brown, perhaps branches
&+Wof saplings, or tough reeds from a pond nearby the village. The man says
&+Wa few words of greeting as you pass by, but does not make a sales pitch.
&+WPerhaps he has a store where he sells his wares too, or this basked is
&+Wfor personal use. The craftsman looks like a regular farmer, and cannot
&+Wbe distinguished from most other villagers by his clothing.&N

adventurer wandering~
&+La wandering &+Badventurer&n~
&+bAn &+Badventurer &+bfrom out of town is here, probably for supplies.&N
~
&+CA young man who is dressed differently from the others, this one looks like
&+Chis is not from Mosswood Village. Instead of the plain green or brown garb
&+Cthat most men wear, he is dressed in a respectable array of leather that
&+Cmakes him look like an adventurer. A mace hangs from a loop in his belt,
&+Cwhich also contains several pouches. The Northern Road is nearby, and so
&+Cis Waterdeep, and both of these are frequented by people seeking to make
&+Ctheir fortunes. Mosswood Village has several supply stores, so it is faster
&+Cto stop here than to head further towards Waterdeep if one is coming from
&+Cthe north. The adventurer pays you no attention as he looks for a store.&N

merchant~
&+ya &+ymerchant from &+cVerspin&N~
&+yA merchant from &+cVerspin &+yhas made the short journey here to do business.&N
~
&+YThis man is a member of the upper middle class in Waterdeep, the city of
&+YSplendor. It is located just south of Mosswood Village, several hours by
&+Yhorse or wagon and consequently there is regular business between the two.
&+YMosswood Village produces a lot of crops, while Waterdeep sells almost
&+Yeverything else, and the two trade or sell their own to the other. This
&+Ymerchant is wearing clothes that identify him as not being a simple farmer,
&+Yas they are clean and a more than a step up from a jerkin. He looks like
&+Yhe is serious and intent on doing business, but does not scowl or otherwise
&+Yintimidate the poorer townsfolk. The merchant looks at you quizically, as
&+Yif wondering what your purpose in the town is.&N

&+wA citizen of &+GWoodseer &+whas come here to buy something not available elsewhere.&N
~
&+rThis man is not a villager from here. What exactly sets him apart is hard
&+rto lay one's finger on, but be it his manner, clothing or features, he is
&+rjust slightly different. He probably hails from the nearby Waterdeep, for
&+rhe does not look like a native of the north, nor does he look like an
&+radventurer. Waterdhavian citizens sometimes make their way to this village
&+rto buy food they sell with a slight profit at the markets back in the city
&+rof splendor, or to buy something that is not available back home. He is a
&+rman of average height, and does not look wealthy or poor, just a commoner.&N

&+Ba barbarian&n~
&+BA large and brawny man strides through the village confidently, looking around.&N
~
&+BTaller and more muscular than a normal human, this man has something primitive
&+Babout him. His forehead is wide and sloped while thick, bushy brows cover his
&+Beyes. Thick lips are set in a wide jaw that connects to an even wider neck. He
&+Bis wearing a lot of furs, which means he is probably from the colder north. A
&+Blarge club has a leather loop tied to its handle, which has been fastened to a
&+Bstrap of the pack on his shoulders. He does not look particularly bright, but
&+Bit might be a wise idea not to taunt him for he might have a volatile temper.
&+BPerhaps he is on his way to Waterdeep, but then again Mosswood Village is near
&+BRoad Crossing from where one can travel anywhere. Thus, he may be headed in
&+Bany of a great many directions. The barbarian stands still as he looks at you,
&+Bfrom head to toe, but then he continues on his way without so much as a word.&N

&+LAn &+revil &+Llooking man keeps to himself as he walks to wherever he is going.&N
~
&+LThis man looks like either a rogue or a wizard. He is wearing a robe that
&+Lcan conceal any kind of weapon, but may also identify him as belonging to
&+La particular order of mages. A closer look shows a slit on the back of his
&+Lright hand, which is the mark of the apprentices of the Citadel. It has
&+Lbeen cut into his hand over and over until it formed a permanent scar. The
&+Lapprentices of the Citadel are in fact accomplished mages, despite their
&+Lname, and they are mostly evil men. The Citadel is located in the center
&+Lof Lake Skeldrach, which is located far to the east, several days' travel
&+Lfrom here. He may be in town to purchase supplies, or meet with the mage
&+Lwho is rumored to live somewhere in or near Mosswood Village.&N

&+yof the pond. He seems immersed in thought and does not take note of you
&+yimmediately, looking somewhat surprised when at last he does, and a bit
&+yirritated at being disturbed. He looks to be somewhere between twenty
&+yand thirty years of age, and his hair and beard are scruffy. His clothes

&+glayer of slime covers its green skin, and it looks like an easy target
&+gfor any predator because it looks unable to move quickly. Surely this
&+gis a deception, or it would have been hunted to extinction already. The
&+gtoad's big eyes are fixed on one point, but surely it is aware of what
&+ggoes on around it. It looks well fed, this must be a good home for it.&N

&+Ychestplate, leaving only his back exposed, and a padded cloth pants and
&+Yshirt. It is strange to see him Mosswood Village, because this town has a
&+Yfew watchmen of its own, and nothing much ever happens here. Perhaps it is

&+yfur of its coat is very short, and is an orange shade of brown with a white
&+ytuft around its tail. The deer has black eyes and no antlers, so it is either
&+ya juvenile or a female. Deer like this roams the woods in all parts of Faerun,
&+yand the woods here north of Waterdeep are no exception. They are usually very
&+yshy and quick to flee because they are prized game and make for good eating,
&+ysurely the townsfolk of Mosswood Village will kill them when they have the
&+ychance. Strangely enough, this deer looks frozen in fear and does not run.&N

&+Lat a truly amazing and hyperactive speed, its many legs moving in unison

&+Lthis close to Waterdeep, and certainly this close near the village. The
&+Lspider gradually moves closer every time it runs by, perhaps choosing a

&+Ywhich are raised from its skull, so it has excellent peripheral vision.
&+YThe frog is a collection of bright colours, green, yellow and orang being
&+Ythe most important ones. These make it easy to spot, but surely they also
&+Yserve another purpose. The most likely one is that its coat serves as a
&+Ywarning to predators that it is highly poisonous. The frog's throat moves

&+yof these, but it is impossible to count without going closer and a set

&+yarmor, the best of which may be some leather bracers, and it is mostly

&+WA beautiful little &+mfa&+Mir&+mie &+Wflutters through the air here, looking very frail&N
~
&+WThis lovely little creature is a faerie, a miniature version of an elf with
&+Wtiny wings. It flutters around the area here before the brook, playing with
&+Wother faeries and a small pseudodragon. It giggles and its voice is almost
&+Wlike a song, while its wings move so fast that the flapping cannot be heard
&+Wand their movement is a blur. The faerie flies in some circles when it sees
&+Wyou, then darts in, hovers right in front of you for several seconds and
&+Wthen travels gracefully back to the others. In those few seconds, one can
&+Wsee tiny blue eyes with a sparkle in them, a testimony to the fun these tiny
&+Welves try to have in life. Its face radiates friendliness, and a gentle smile
&+Wwas on its face. The faerie looks very frail, but there could be nothing that
&+Wwants to hurt such a gentle and loving creature save for the twisted orcs.&N

pseudodragon little mischievous~
&+Ba pseudodragon&N~
&+bA mischievous little &+Bpseudodragon &+blies in the grass, snapping playfully at the &+mfa&+Mir&+mies.&N
~
&+BWhether this is a pseudodragon or a faerie dragon is not clear, but it is
&+Bcertainly a friendly variant of dragonkin. Like the faeries flying around
&+Babove it, it has a smile on its face and its giggle sounds like the tinkling
&+Bof small bells. Its tiny scales are bright blue, and it is very small for a
&+Bdragon, not larger than fiver feet in length, and its body is thin and frail.
&+BThe pseudo- or faerie dragon's wings are like gossamer butterfly wings, and
&+Bone can see right through them. Its colour is an indicator of its age, as
&+Bfaerie dragons are born red and this slowly changes to black as they reach
&+Bthe age of a great wyrm. This one would be an adult, but it still snaps at
&+Band plays with the faeries as if it were a playful child. All pseudodragons
&+Bare playful, no matter what their age, and this one is no exception.&N

&+LA bat clings to something in a hole in the rock, oblivious to what goes on outside.&N
~
&+LSqueezed into a hole in the rock, this bat cannot be very comfortable.
&+LIt is the size of a good bird, but is a little longer. If it would open
&+Lits wings, one could see that it is actually a very thin creature, but
&+Lwith its wings folded shut it looks a little more imposing. It uses the
&+Lhole here to sleep in, and must set out at night to capture insects. The
&+Lnearby village with its water and crops should ensure a steady supply of
&+Lbugs, and the boulder here provides enough cracks to shelter the bat.&N

&+wA medium sized &+ybear &+whas made this cave its home, growling menacingly.&N
~
&+yThis bear lies on the floor of the cave, up in the back against the wall.
&+yIt looks like a large creature, and perhaps it has awoken from its slumber
&+yto go out and find some food. It growls when it senses a presence in its
&+ycave, and it might be wise to leave it alone while it has not yet fully
&+yrecovered from its sleep. The bear has a thick coat of brown fur, and a
&+ylarge black nose that glistens because it is wet. It could probably stand
&+yin excess of six feet if it rises upon two feet, and can deliver crushing
&+yblows with its strong arms and clawed paws. The bear's growl continues.&N

&+cThis creature has crept up into the opening under an overhang here, but it
&+cis quite easily visible as it has aquamarine colored scales. The animal is
&+csomewhat like a crocodile, but its body is narrower and more like a snake.
&+cIt is a behir, a reptilian monster that has a dozen legs which allow it to
&+cscale almost any rocks and cliffs, while they can also retract alongside
&+cits body so it can move like a snake. There are two horns protruding from
&+cbehind its head, making it look even more fearsome. It seems to be asleep.&N

&+LA large insectoid creature, it also has a tail section like a lobster.
&+LThis cave fisher has eight legs, like spiders, and its chitinous plates
&+Loverlap and provide it with excellent protection from bludgeoning blows.
&+LIts front two legs are equipped with powerful pincers, used both to kill
&+Lprey and to dismember it. Like the name suggests, cave fishers prefer
&+Lunderground caverns such as caves, dungeons and the Underdark, although
&+Lthey can rarely be seen in rocky regions on the surface. It remains still.&N

&+Yto sleep with one eye open, and still be able to spot predators coming
&+Yfrom the front. It has a nice mixed coat of light brown, white and beige,
&+Ywhich has diamond like patterns on its belly. The owl is a predator that
&+Yhunts on small snakes and rodents, which there must be a plentiful supply
&+Yof with the nearby farms of Mosswood Village. The owl appears to be asleep.&N

&+yThis majestic bird looks extremely cunning. Its sharp beak and wide eyes

&+yThe falcon sits on a fence pole here, overlooking a field of corn nearby.
&+yIts sharp eyes scan every nook and cranny, and any rodent caught in its
&+yvision surely risks death at the falcon's impressive claws. It looks at
&+yyou quizically, ready to fly at an instant's notice should a threat present
&+yitself. It looks like a fine beast, and a top predator around the farms.&N

&+ybe larger than two feet tall, and has brown hair and bright blue eyes. It
&+ystands here in the stalls, where it probably crept in through a hole in
&+ythe planks and boards. It is a brownie, a benign creature that sometimes
&+ylives on or near farms because of their love of all creatures and live-
&+ystock. If they choose, they can vanish at will, and they can never be
&+ysurprises, so this one obviously thought no harm in remaining visible.
&+yThe brownie is feeding some grass to a calf, and whispers something to
&+yit but this cannot be heard from here. The brownie smiles sweetly.&N

&+gbelt containing trinkets and other useless items, which probably makes
&+ghim a gremlin. The pouches are open and small shiny objects can be seen.&N

&+wwhich ranges from brown to grey, this fremlin is a slate colour. Gremlins
&+wlike to cause trouble as they are relatively worthless fighters, and fremlins

&+LThe dog is as large as the child, and it would be a good guard dog. Still,
&+Lit is friendly to the child, and seems to accept him as someone to obey. It
&+Lhas a spotted coat of fur, but its mainstay is a &+ybrown &+Lsimilar to that of
&+Lworgs. It looks like some of its direct ancestors may have had some wolf or
&+Lworg blood in them. It barks as it waits for the child to throw again.&N

large black bird raven~
&+La large black bird&N~
&+LA large bird resembling a raven flies through the branches.&N
~
&+LThis big bird is large even though it swoops through the air at some distance.
&+LIts feathers are all black, while its beak is yellow. Despite its size, it
&+Ldoes not look like it is a carnivorous bird for it lacks the large claws that
&+Lfalcons, for example, have. Perhaps it is quite old and has grown to these
&+Lproportions due to the abundance of food present on the nearby farms of Moss-
&+Lwood Village. It flies through the brances at high speed, and is very adept at
&+Lthis because it does not hit a single one. It makes no sound at all, and lands
&+Lon a branch from where it stares at you for several seconds before moving on.&N

&+LA &+Csoldier &+Lstands next to the gate, bored with his guard duty.&N
~
&+bLeaning against a tree next to the gate, this man looks longingly at the
&+bencampent further west where his comrades are sitting, talking and training.
&+bHe has probably been assigned to stand guard here, for something must be
&+bspecial about the area to the east of the gate. There should not be any
&+bsoldiers in this area, and their presence indicates something is awry. He
&+blooks like a regular soldier, without any fancy armor or weapons, but with
&+bsimple stock items that are nevertheless sufficient to perform the task.
&+bSeeing you here causes him some surprise, and he looks about ready to talk
&+bto anyone passing by to give him a break from his apparently boring watch.&N

&+yA large boar with a thick coat of fur has come here to &+Cdrink.&N
~
&+yA stocky and strong creature, this pig-like creature is covered in a thick
&+ycoat of hair. Pieces of leaves and twigs stick out of it in places, and a
&+ydried clumps of mud on its belly indicate it has been through soggy ground.
&+yIt stands here drinking from the stream which emerges from the rock, its
&+ydisproportionately large head adding to its stocked appearance. Two small
&+ytusks protrude from its mouth and it has a snout just like a pig does. It
&+ygrunts regularly, and despite its short legs it is doubtlessly capable of
&+yincredible bursts of speed. Perhaps it is wise not to bother the animal.&N

&+LGoing through the field here, this boy guides the beanstalks up the sticks

&+Lthat it continues its growth towards the top. Also, he removes leaves which
&+Lare large, for whatever reason that may be, and picks weeds out of the ground.
&+LHe is around seventeen and looks like he will be a strong farmer, the work
&+Laround the farm strengthening him. Stubble covers parts of his face and he
&+Lcould really use a shave, or a bath for that matter. He looks blankly at you.&N

&+WShe looks very experienced at what she is doing, moving the small knife with

&+Wnot wearing anything to prevent stains on her clothing, but by their looks a
&+Wnew blotch would not matter anyway. She is somewhat portly.&N

&+gthe normal collection of brown clothes, instead wearing both a green pants
&+gand jerkin. He is wearing boots that look like they have been in a swamp.&N

&+chis walk through the crops here looking for something, and they both carry a
&+cmakeshift weapon. In the farmer's case it is a heavy rake - a wooden pole with
&+ca heavy iron toothed section. What could possibly be the cause of this is best
&+casked, but it is possible a wolf or other beast has been sighted on the farm.&N

&+YIt is hard to distinguish him from the many other villagers, as they all seem
&+Yto wear the same simple brown garb. He looks enthusiastic about what they are

&+Yhas a wooden club with a nail driven through it in his hand, and his father
&+Ywields a heavy rake as though it were a weapon. They seem to be looking for
&+Ysomething in the fields. The boy frowns when he sees you in their crops.&N

&+rabout the house and several older ones could be seen around outside, and she
&+rhas to take care of all of them and the household as well. As a result, the
&+rinside of the house has probably been given a lower priority, and many things
&+reither need cleaning of fixing. Her hand supports her chin as she dozes off.&N
