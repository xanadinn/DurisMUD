&+yA small &+Lra&+wt&+Lling&+y scurries about the floor.&n

&+r   This appears to be a small &+Lr&+wa&+Lt,&+r but its eyes seem more intelligent than a&n
&+rnormal rat, and its front paws seem more like little hands than paws.  It is&n
&+rrushing through the straw on the floor, looking for anything that is edible,&n
&+reven the &+yb&+ru&+ygs&+r that move too slow.&n

&+rSomething that looks like a &+wr&+La&+wt &+rsits watching.&n

&+r   Though this &+ccreature's&+r body is shaped like a &+wrat,&+r its intelligent eyes show&n
&+rthat it is not a &+wrat.&+r  It sits in the &+Ystraw&+r watching all that is happening, an&n
&+roval object held in its paws.  On closer examination, it can be seen that this&n
&+robject is a smooth &+ys&+Yt&+yone&+r and when a &+bspider&+r appears, the &+wra&+Lt&+wkin&+r hurls the &+ys&+Yt&+yone&n
&+rwith deadly accuracy at the &+bspider.&+r  It is clear that the &+wra&+Lt&+wkin&+r is protecting
&+rthe &+Lra&+wt&+Llings&+r as they search for something to eat.&n

&+ymakes as it sways around the cook.&n

&+yA m&+ra&+yl&+rjer&+y flits from shadow to shadow, searching for easy prey.&n
~
&+y   This sneaky little humanoid moves almost without a sound from one shadow to&n
&+ythe next, searching for someone who is being careless so that she may take the&n
&+ythings she wishes to steal from them.  She is considered pretty, for a m&+ra&+yl&+rjer,&n
&+ybut her very wrinkled skin and almost noseless face would not be pretty to any&n
&+yother than another &+rma&+yl&+rjer.&+y  Though her big brown eyes give her an air of sweet&n
&+yinnocence, only an idiot would believe that this evil little creature has ever&n
&+yhad a single innocent thought.&n

&+Gthe cell with him in any way that he could.  He and his friends keep trying to&n
&+Gfollow the &+mjudge's&+G orders, and sometimes they even succeed in getting past the&n
&+Chuman's&+G defenses.  They sit and plot the many different ways they can make her&n
&+Gscream, only to be frustrated most of the time, as she either just bears their&n
&+Gtormenting or she manages to keep them away from her.  But, the few times that&n
&+Gtheir plans have worked have kept them continuing to try. When he is observant&n
&+Gto see one of the little &+gsl&+wi&+gmy th&+wi&+gngs&+G before the others do, he usually manages&n
&+Gto catch a little bit of protein as a reward.&n

~
&+r   Only half of its &+Lflat black feathers&+r remain to cover the wrinkled, scrawny&n
&+wgrey body&+r on this little bird.  Though it looks almost skeletal, its eyes are&n
&+rbright, almost glowing they are so &+Bblue.&+r  It creeps around instead of flying,&n
&+rthough when children run near, it blasts up into the air to avoid them.  When&n
&+rit does fly, even more of its sparse feathers fall out upon the ground.  They&n
&+rare rumored to be the eyes of the &+blord&+r of the &+Lkeep,&+r and those who live in the&n
&+rtown usually give them a wide berth.&n

&+y   This halfling must be of the Tallfellow strain, as she is a bit taller than&n
&+ymost - almost as tall as a dwarf.  She is also a bit rounder than most of them&n
&+yseem to be.  But the look in her eyes makes it clear that she is not much like&n
&+ythe jovial halflings found almost everywhere.  Even the children who live here&n
&+yleave Big Sal alone, and they don't seem to fear much of anything.&n

&+ythe front gate, and all of the family with them died with them.  Sometimes he&n
&+ymisses them, but his life is much too busy, filled with learning a craft that&n
&+yhe cares a lot more about than he ever cared about them.  He is proud that he&n
&+yis good enough at it that he has been chosen to be the one to sell the things&n
&+ythat have been created when customers enter the shop.&n

&+rHe greatly enjoys being a ranger, having always had a certain ability to sense&n

&+ridea of the way he needed to go, so he learned how to track things down, using&n

&+rskills to hunt down his enemies.&n

&+yButterfoot&n~
&+yA halfling named Butterfoot stands watching the cooks at work.&n
~
&+y   Butterfoot seems to just be watching the cooks at work, but he actually is&n
&+ybusy practicing his skills while he waits for his student to arrive.  When an&n
&+yunsuspecting cook rushes past, he neatly lifts one of the things she holds in&n
&+yher hands, deftly stealing it away from her without her even seeing him doing&n
&+yit.  He hums as he returns the item unnoticed, only to steal from another one&n
&+yas she goes past.  Though he seems to be immersed in what his hands are doing&n
&+yhe is watching all who pass, trying to find which one is the person he agreed&n
&+yto teach the skills of thievery.&n

~
&+r   After watching others have unspeakable deaths at the hands of &+bHammerhead,&n
&+rthis &+yhalfling&+r has decided that he is not going to go out quietly.  He shouts&n
&+rhis defiance at the &+blord&+r of the &+Ldark keep&+r as well as at his predicament.  He&n
&+rstill has hopes that friends will come rescue him before the lord comes back&n
&+rto devour his essence, and he wants to make sure they can hear how to get to&n
&+rthis cell in a hurry.&n

&+rand he doesn't understand why.  From what he saw as he went through the town,&n
&+rthere would be plenty of children to play with here, and it sure seems like a&n
&+rsafer place than where they came from.  So he plays quietly, waiting until he&n
&+reither has to leave here, either to a new home here in town or out to another&n
&+rtown to look for another home there.&n

&+rbut he is not blind or deaf and knows that once they agree to live here that&n
&+rthey will probably never be allowed to leave. In fact, he is sure that it is&n

&+rA hungry &+gthri-&+Ykreen&+r stands watching the court proceedings.&n
~
&+r   A few drops of acidy saliva dripping from his mandibles, this &+gthri-&+Ykreen&+r is&n
&+rwatching to see if the &+mjudge&+r sentences anyone to the stocks.  He does not have&n
&+rvery high hopes of it happening, as there have been very few cases lately, but&n
&+rhe still comes to see if there is any chance for fresh meat daily.  It ignores&n
&+rthe &+Ggith&+Wyanki&+r that is trying to aggravate people.&n

&+La wat&+rching &+Lmino&+rtaur&n~
&+rA &+Lwat&+rching &+Lmino&+rtaur pays close attention to the &+mjudge.&n
~
&+r   This &+Lmino&+rtaur looks as though she would rather be pacing among the chairs,&n
&+rbut everyone knows how tempermental the &+mjudge&+r is, so she stands watching from&n
&+ra safe distance.  She comes here once a week to observe how the &+mjudge&+r applies&n
&+rthe laws commanded by the &+blord&+r of the &+Lkeep&+r as she wishes to be a &+mjudge&+r in the&n
&+rcourt one day.  Until that day comes, she is content to watch a master &+mjudge,&n
&+rand learn from her how to be effective at what she does.&n

hooded nuisance figure humanoid~
&+ca hooded nuisance&n~
&+rA &+chooded&+r figure makes a &+cnuisance&+r of itself.&n
~
&+r   This hunched figure is about five-foot-tall, but it is wearing a cloak with&n
&+ra large hood which conceals its face completely.  It is constantly whispering,&n
&+rasking anyone close to it what the &+mjudge&+r meant by what she just said.  Most of&n
&+rthe others in the room try to ignore the nuisance, but the strange clawed feet&n
&+rthat show beneath the long cloak catch their attention, making it harder to be&n
&+rindifferent to what the hooded figure is saying.&n

young observer~
&+ca young observer&n~
&+rA &+cyoung observer&+r watches the judge, a look of worship on its misshapen face.&n
~
&+r   With a distorted &+chumanoid&+r face, it really is hard to tell much about the&n
&+rrace or sex of this creature, but the look of adoration in its eyes when it&n
&+rwatches the &+mjudge&+r is unmistakable.  Its face looks as though it was painted&n
&+rby a child with paints that ran in unusual directions or that it was shaped&n
&+rfrom clay that was then overheated so that it melted a bit in spots.  While&n
&+rthe forehead is lumpy, the chin is almost completely non-existant.  It does&n
&+rhave two eyes that show intelligence, but it has no nose and no lips on its&n
&+rwide, sloping mouth.  It has two arms and two legs but none of them are the&n
&+rsame lengths.  Its dark grey skin and light gray tufts of hair do not match&n
&+rthe description of any race that has ever been heard of, either.&n

bewildered bystander humanoid~
&+ca bewildered bystander&n~
&+rA &+cbewildered bystander&+r asks questions of all who pass.&n
~
&+r   This &+chumanoid&+r has features that do not match those of any known race, much&n
&+rless each other.  Its face is uneven, as though a child had made a normal one&n
&+rfrom clay and then partially melted it.  The skull itself is distorted, as if&n
&+rthe bones on one side grew larger than the other and the skin hangs in uneven&n
&+rfolds all around the head.  Tufts of coarse, light gray hair grow on its head&n
&+rin random patches, giving it the appearance of a poorly made rag doll.  Hands&n
&+rwith only three fingers can be seen while the feet that show beneath the long&n
&+rcloak are clawed.  When it walks, its gait is very uneven, naking it seem the&n
&+rcreature should fall over instead of walking upright.  It goes from person to&n
&+rperson, asking why there are people on the stocks, demanding to know why such&n
&+ra barbaric practice is allowed to continue.&n

&+Ca stammering man&n~
&+rA &+Cman&+r stands before the &+mjudge,&+r stammering out his defense.&n
~
&+r   It is clear from the expression on his face that this man knows he probably&n
&+rwill end up on the stocks out in the courtyard.  He was accused of attacking a&n
&+rduergar child, and his attempt at explaining that he was at the Blood&+wMoon&+r when&n
&+rit happened is so confused that it sounds as though he is lying.  The judge is&n
&+rclearly no longer listening to his stammered defense, which is just making him&n
&+rlook worse.&n

~
&+r   Standing still, as though meditating, this &+cg&+yian&+ct&+r waits for his turn to see&n
&+rthe &+blord&+r of the &+Lkeep.&+r  He is here as an &+yam&+cb&+yassa&+cd&+yor&+r to try to discuss a treaty&n
&+rwith this town to attempt to keep his native lands free from the &+bHammerhead's&n
&+rrule.  From what he has observed he has high hopes that some sort of alliance&n
&+rcan be worked out with Hammerhead that would benefit them both.  While he has&n
&+rbeen waiting, he has assessed the strength of the force &+bHammerhead&+r has in the&n
&+rtown, and has decided that it would be for the best if an alliance is made as&n
&+rsoon as possible.&n

&+r   This small creature dashes about the town, looking for those in need of any&n

&+ra smile on her face as her bright eyes search the walkway she is striding down&n
&+rin hopes of joining a fight in progress.&n

&+r   This small bipedal creature struts down the walkway dressed in a miniature&n
&+rset of platemail, looking for a fight so that he can help defend the one that&n
&+rhe chooses without getting into any trouble.  His little snout twitches as he&n
&+rsearches for trouble that he can try to solve.  It is quite clear that he has&n
&+ran ego that is far bigger than his small little body should contain.&n

&+rDressed in a mixture of &+yleather&+r and &+Cchain&n&+r armor, a &+Lmino&n&+rtaur stands silently in the room.&n
~
&+r     Standing an imposing height, the threat posed by this &+Lmino&+rtaur&n
&+ris increased by the armor he is wearing.   The &+Cchain&n&+r gleams, almost&n
&+rbright as a mirror it is so polished. The leather that shows behind&n
&+rthe chain pieces is &+ydark&+r, most of it covered with mystic runes that&n
&+rglint with an occasional dark light.&n

&+rWith a disdainful leer on his face, this &+Ydwarf&n&+r leans back against the wall.&n
~
&+r     Though she appears to be dressed in just a simple hooded robe, the&n
&+rmetallic sound of armor beneath the robe makes it clear that this is no&n
&+rsimple student of magic.   She seems to not be paying attention to what&n
&+ris going on in the room at all, but at the least bit of movement, it is&n
&+rclear that she is very well aware of everything happening in here.&n
