This is a help file for coders.  It's designed to help you learn how to
  add stuff to the mud without breaking anything.  Please note that a
  good rule to follow is that nothing is up to date, but this can be a good
  starting place.

Howto Add a Spell:
  First, add the SPELL_<SPELLNAME> <number> to the list in spells.h (search for LAST_SPELL).
    <number> should be 1 greater than the last spell listed.
    Increment LAST_SPELL to be the same as SPELL_<SPELLNAME>
  Second, write the spell stub definition in the appropriate file (smagic for shaman, blispells for blighter, etc).
    Write the spell stub in the appropriate .h file (blispells.h or prototypes.h etc.)
  Third, write a link in skills.c: CREATE_SPELL( .. ) or CREATE_SPELL_MSG( .. ).
    Just copy/double paste a similar spell and make proper changes to the second paste.
  Fourth, add the spell to the proper classes/specs via SPELL_ADD( .. ) or SPEC_SPELL_ADD( .. ).
    Note: the second number is the circle for the spell (ie. 2 => They get it at 6th level in 2nd circle).
  Fourth, write the spell definition after verifying that everything compiles right.
  Fifth, test the spell!
  Sixth, commit/push your new spell.

Howto Add an Epic Type:
  First, add the type in epic.h (EPIC_... <number> where number is next in line).
  Second, use the type where the gain_epic function is called.
  Third, edit gain_epic function in epic.c to realize the new type (in switch statement).

Howto Add a Material Type:
  First, add the type in objmisc.h (and increment MAT_HIGHEST).
  Second, add the name of the material in common.c (in item_material[] and materials[]).
  Third, update material_parameters in salchemist.c (hardiness, magic_power, preferred_weapon, adjective).
  Now, go to mud/areas/de/src:
    Fourth, add the name of the material in common.c (in materials[]).
    Fifth, add MAT_<new material> in objmisc.h (and increment MAT_HIGHEST).
    Sixth, add MAT_<new material> in obj/material.h (and increment MAT_HIGHEST).

Howto Add a Spldam Type:
  First, goto damage.h and add the type and increment LAST_SPLDAM_TYPE.
  Second, goto fight.c and add the text for the type in spldam_types[].
  Third, fix the hardcoded line in actwiz.c in stat_spldam to list the new type in the header.

Howto Add a Boon Reward Type:
  First, goto boon.h and add BTYPE_... and increment MAX_BTYPE.
  Second, goto boon.c and add a line in boon_types struct.
  Third, in boon.c, add the necessary lines in boon_data array.
    Add 1 line for each option available to new type.
  Fourth, in boon.c, update " &+ctype&n [expm|exp|epic..." under boon "?" in do_boon.
  Fifth, in boon.c, review and update parse_boon_args if applicable.
    Add "else if( bdata->type == BTYPE_... )" in parse_boon_args.
      Add handling for bonus.
      Add handling for bonus2 if applicable.
    Add "case BTYPE_...:" in the switch( bdata->type ) under case BARG_BONUS in parse_boon_args.
      Add handling for error message numbers from validate_boon_data (defined next step).
  Sixth, in boon.c, review and update validate_boon_data if applicable.
    Add "case BTYPE_...:" in the switch( bdata->type ) under case BARG_BONUS.
      Define error messages via return value (handled in parse_boon_args).
  Seventh, in boon.c, goto boon_display and update the display for the new type.
    Add "case BTYPE_...:" in switch(type).
  Lastly, in boon.c, review and update check_boon_completion to give PC a reward.
    Add "case BTYPE_...:" in the switch( bdata.type )

Howto Add a Command:
  First, in interp.h, add CMD_<new command>.
  Second, in config.h, increment MAX_CMD by 1. 
  Third, in interp.c, add "<new command>", to the end of command[] (before the "\n").
  Fourth, in interp.c, add CMD_*(CMD_<new command>, STAT_<MIN STAT> + POS_<MIN POS>, do_<new function name>, <MIN LVL>)
    CMD_* refers to the type of command you are creating (CMD_GRT/CMD_N/CMD_Y/CMD_CNF_N/etc).
    STAT_<MIN STAT> is the minimum state of the char necessary to execute the command (NORMAL/SLEEPING/DEAD/etc).
    POS_<MIN_POS> is the minimum position of the char (PRONE/KNEELING/SITTING/STANDING).
    do_<new function name> is the name of the function that will be executed when this command is done.
    <MIN LVL> is the lowest level the command is available to.
  Fifth, in prototypes.h, define "void do_<new function name>(P_char ch, char *arg, int cmd);"
  Sixth, in whatever .c file is most appropriate, define the new function.

Howto Add an Innate:
  First, in structs.h, add INNATE_<new innate> and increment LAST_INNATE.
  Second, in innates.c, add to the end of innate_data the new name of the innate,
    and, if there is a function associated with it ("innate <function>"), put the function as the second argument.
    Otherwise, put NULL as the second variable.
  Third, in innates.c, if there's an innate function associated with it, define the function.
  Fourth, in innates.c, assign the innate to the appropriate classes/races in assign_innates().
  Fifth, if there's no "innate <function>" for the innate, hardcode the innate into the game where appropriate.
    Use "has_innate(ch, INNATE_<new innate>)" to check for it.
